Also, the things are too expensive for so little rewards. I don't like that each time energy is purchased, the next purchase is double the previous. Also, I don't like that playing the cake merge has no purpose. It would make more sense if we could earn energy just by playing the cake merge or at least by watching ads.",

    "content": "Fun for a bit, but then the items you need to make get so long and complicated there is absolutely no way you can make progress without having to watch ads every minute, and even then the number of ads is limited so you have to pay to play. Plus the items you can buy are so expensive wdym 100 energy cost goes from 10 to 20 to 80 gems and even that only allows you to complete like 1/5 of a single order Frustrating... Deleted 👎",

    "content": "I really enjoy playing this game to relax, and am happy just merging and discovering new dishes/participating in events. What I don't love is that the daily rewards tree and multiple opportunities to get more energy during the day by watching ads have both seemingly been removed? Those features made the game accessible for those of us who can't spend money on a phone game. Bring them back, please. Edit: Not changing my rating, in fact I'm lowering it, as the points made above were ignored.",

I got 5 items out of it before it blocked again so again I kept paying to unblock the generator but it kept blocking up. Completely rigged so I couldn't make the last order in time.",

    "content": "Let me play the damn game, this annoying piece of work is always in tutorial mode. It doesn't even take a second after doing anything for a big hand to obscure your view telling you what to do. Every single move, every single time. Besides that, everything else is terrible. The intro scene ruins most of the motivation for playing the game. The merge mechanics require very frequent and long wait times. There is not a shred of originality in the game besides trying to milk microtransactions.",

Se io clicco sull'icona \"x\" per chiudere la pubblicità, non deve rimandarmi al sito o al play store per scaricarla: è una pratica molto fastidiosa e invasiva, che spesso ti costringe a far ripartire l'app. grazie!",

    "content": "The event rewards are very little, even though it takes a lot of effort, energy, and many merged items to complete them. The rewards feel too ‘cheap’ compared to what we have to spend. Higher-level generators don’t feel any different from lower-level ones—they should produce more high-level items. On top of that, the energy recharge takes too long. It’s getting boring.",

This has been my go-to merge game for a few years, but I didn't like the way the generators went back into cooldown immediately after one cooldown ended if you used it right away. Recently there have been a lot of features added that has made the game more playable (e.g. ads to pop bubbles, ads for energy, occasional unlimited generator use, etc.) Good work, devs. Keep doing what you're doing. 🤘🏻✌🏻",

The game is entertaining but I would say it's best for people who have patience. I let things cook and return to the game after my energy refills. My biggest gripe is that it takes forever to make some high level items. As you progress into the later levels this becomes more and more egregious. You make the same high level items often.",

I really enjoy this game so I'm feeling very grateful I never deleted the game and stayed patient for this awesome update . thank you so much. great game only reason why I give 3 stars is because of space , there should be extra storage space for generators and things like that . the lack of space gets frustrating . it's not challenging, it's frustrating. but otherwise great game 🙏",

However, I've noticed a couple things that would improve gameplay. When generators run out of energy, it would be nice to have an actual minute/second timer on when they regain energy. Also, how many energy clicks you have left on generators would be helpful. One more addition would be the option to undo an accidental merge.",

I thought this was going to be fun. THIS GAME IS PAY TO PLAY. Dont recommend",

I understand that you need to make money on these games by people buying stuff to get further but damn make it a little easier for us to progress without having to spend so much and you don't even get any things worth paying for.",

They need the pots and BBQs added!!!! LOTS OF PEOPLE COMPLAINING ABOUT THE BBQ and non working ads to get your free items. You can press on the item to bring up an ad a hundred times and nothing. Yes I have counted.",

I'm really disappointed that the ad wasn't truthful to the gameplay. Atleast the ad showed a unique and intriguing game that I haven't seen before.",

Sometimes if you speed it up you get 4. I have 10 generators all on cool down and the only way to speed them up is to buy packs. It's miserable. After the first couple levels your board gets cluttered and it's hard to finish orders unless you spend a lot of money. Which I'm not willing to do.",

    "content": "It kept flashing back. I would have place stuff in the oven or the mixing bowl and started the process. But when I come back hours later it would still just have the raw ingredients. Very frustrating. I looked up FAQ, make sure my version is up to date still no help. edit: after 3 years, I started playing again. Still the same problem. Occasionally the game flashes back and the cooking process will be undone. Still not fixed after 3 years",

But I thought that after the generator n equipment get leveled up, more of the food/drink is become more. but no. like the peanut, ice cube, egg. there's no chicken wing etc. so is not really worth it to lvl up the generator",

    "content": "I have played this game for months and enjoyed it immensely. However, this latest update has taken away the option to watch ads for energy except for once a day. I used to be able to get more energy every hour or so. this has made it so that I can only play for a couple minutes at a time. This is boring and I am rapidly losing interest. Response: umm, no. The availability of ads is not the problem. The problem is that there are not enough opportunities to watch the ads and that is on you.",

    "content": "Soooo good. I really like this game. I play alot of different merge games, but what i really enjoy on this one is that you can cook, grill, or squeeze fruits and make drinks. My favorite part is designing and rebuilding, aside from reading the story. The graphics are a big thing for me. I love the colors and the cute graphs. Its captivating and intriguing and I wanna just keep and keep playing. I almost didn't try it because I already have enough games- but honestly Im so glad I gave this a try.",

    "content": "I have had this game for a while but since I'm at a harder level it takes 3-4 days to complete ONE order and that's with using gems w/o spending useless money to give me more energy. I am uninstalling because the past 7 levels or rounds of orders have taken me 2 weeks to do. I don't like logging in, playing for 10 minutes, and then having to wait hours to play for 10 more minutes to barely make progress. It's not fun anymore.",

Just be aware that despite how good it is, in the end, it's a scam to take our money. Lost my progress and everything somehow. I was at 155.",

    "content": "I've been playing for about a month now. The energy cap is annoying, but it's a game that I play a few times a day. I think there must have been an update in the last week. I am extremely pleased with the new option to watch ads for energy and to speed up the timers. I ignore most of the mini rounds. I can't opt out and that's annoying. The only negative is the massive amount of BUY THIS BUNDLE ads. 5 or 6 before I can even start playing. All in all a decent game. Stay casual, give it a try!",

    "content": "Nice relaxing game that you don't have to pay to enjoy, ads are optional for bonus extras. My only issue is anytime an event comes around (cycled through the same things pretty regularly) you are forced every time to be shown what to do, there's an option to look at how to play that pops up, I think it should be left at that, especially with how many things pop up as you are playing anyway. Just frustrating sometimes when I already know what to do but forced to go through it again and again.",

    "content": "After playing several merging games of the identical format, I'm very disappointed this game is not player friendly. There are no ads to regain energy or speed up cool down time from dispensing tools and if you use gems to speed up the process it only gives half the amount if you would have just waited. The only reason it's not 1 star is because I'm waiting to see if the update fixes these issues. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.",

Level 4 and I still can't merge what and how I want really. still having the big ol' finger pointing at what I am supposed to click and drag and not allowed to do anything else. tutorials. are good and helpful but they aren't supposed to last forever. its not a difficult game, just makes me feel stupid playing it.",

When I lost all my progress, and despite trying several times, couldn't restore I reached out, (although I didn't hold much hope) within 24hrs, and at the weekend, it's all been restored. I'm so grateful 😊 I have never reviewed a game before, but this totally deserves it 😀",

    "content": "This Game is fun but also addictive if you enjoy cooking and serving. But it will rob you of money which is why I gave it a 1 star. To advance in the game you have to spend a lot of money. And when you do spend money they make the game more challenging. And they have advertisements every time you run out of something or touch something. For this reason I do not recommend this merge game. There are other merge cooking games available in the play store that don't require you spending so much.",

The generators run out of use after maybe 10 taps and then you have to wait indefinitely. There's no timer to see if you have time to do something quick or take a while. It doesn't help with your strategy. The only options are purchase with gems, typically a large sum of them. This game is boring. Find something else.",

They were basically forcing us to watch ads or if you don't want to, buy their 'discount' packs. I bought some, but it's not enough. I regretted my purchase honestly. 2 stars.",

    "content": "My main complaint is with the multiplier. Why am I still getting level 1 items while using a 4x energy boost? If I need a level 1 ingredient, I'm perfectly capable of turning the boost off to get that level 1 item. Reply to devs: They drop repeatedly, not only if I \"don't currently have\" the level 1 item. It happens after I've completed the dish, and until the entire order is filled. I wish it only did it as needed, but that's not the case. Make it work the way you claim, then I'll give 5 stars",

    "content": "I honestly can't recommend this one. It's not exactly bad, but it's not good either. It's pretty much like every other merge games, except this one doesn't have a story to hook you in. Everything costs gems and energy. You can often watch an ad to skip the waiting time. But it feels like you're watching an ad to get 10 extra uses, then it dries out, you watch another ad and get 8 uses. (exaggerated, but you get what I mean)",

It takes all your energy multiple times, plus the ridiculously long wait time for the \"generators\" to recharge. then, even if you consider buying more energy or diamonds, they are outrageously priced. you could pay $5 and only get 50 energy and like 100 diamonds. it's crazy.",

Unfortunately on low income , i am unable to afford to play it . if you don't pay to top up . you have to wait for 1 energy ever so often . Big downside .

    "content": "The monitisation model is getting more obvious and plainly ugly at this point. Orders that requires high level generator items come up too often and the generator gives stinchy amounts every generation. It force you to watch ad and even worse spend on finishing that recipe otherwise you can't finish other seasonal events because you are stuck not earning enough coins to unlock event rewards as no new recipes will come up before that. Wish I can give it another chance but seems hopeless.",

And the fact that the gems needed to get energy double each time throughout the day(10, 20, 40, 80, etc) is likely going to be the thing that eventually leads to me getting so annoyed I stop playing. If they left it at 10, I'd play more often",

It looks like they changed it back where you can watch ads for items again, so I have updated my review. I am glad they listened to the players and changed it back before I uninstalled it.",

The game play is too slow, you either have plenty of energy & generators are down; or generators are full & you're out of energy. Also, they give you little bits of equipment which fill up your board & storage & don't give you enough room for game play which becomes frustrating. It's unfortunate, it would be a great game if they didn't make it so slow & frustrating...& expensive, the prices aren't worth the short play time.",

The game will not let me delete because they are on max level. This is very annoying because it takes up an abundance of space in my storage. Not being able to delete maxed-out objects causes me to have to delete things I need or use more of my hard-earned gems to get more storage space when I could be using them elsewhere.",

What exactly is the point of playing this if the game try to stop you from doing anything per click??",

But than they add possibility to watch adds (only if you choose to watch, otherwise there are no forced adds at all). And now they changed an event in a way, that what I get for free is 3 times more.

Ads would've been fine, except in my current location some ads are clearly scammers advertising fake investment content that takes you via the link to a page, open in browser, no google play. I get it, you are just working with ad providers and not responsible for the content. However, I'm not getting this type of ads in any other game. So please pay attention if you care.",

It might also take awhile in getting materials need to build the item that's been requested by the person. Like that there is no time clock in the game. It froze up.",

    "content": "very worst game. For 1 energy it takes 2 minutes very over. In petal plate party event in last plate I didn't get hammers. hammer will come when we use energies and complete the orders . I used more than 700 energies and i complete more than 15 orders but even 1 hammer didn't came. And when we reach the max level of generators you have to give tools for another generator but you'll give the same generator tools again and again. And to complete the album they never give new cards for the album.",

The removal of ads has made events unwinnable, progress slow, & free premium currency is gone. It's sad the devs care so little for their current player base.",

Why play when I would have to pay if I want to play longer than two minutes. why do you only let select people have ads for free energy? There should be the option for both for everyone, like every other game I've played",

However, because generators spit out other things that you might not need at random, the board fills up quickly, and obtaining gems is so far and few between that you can't buy enough extra slots to make up for the amount of space you need. Also, the cool down for generators is WAY too long",

I have in my to-do list to serve German Snow White Cake but the same ingredients go with Black Forest cake and I cannot continue with the order. Hope it will be resolved very soon! :)",

Just don't spend any real money! As soon as you do, the game or algorithm or whatev gets greedy. No more free ads for items, bubble items, or dog path. I'm lucky I get ads for energy at all but that's it. Every bubble item now costs gems and the dog path is real money only, and no more speed timers. i may quit now.",

Also the increased rate and prices of packages after you've purchased once is disgusting. You do not get your money's worth.",

    "content": "its a great game but energy finishes before orders finish and your prices of purchases for refurbishing goes up and the order of food is not enough to cover cost of repairs my suggestion is that you allow user to watch ads to replenish energy so gamers could finish orders and repairs and more offer of free energy and rubies and generator does not have enough goods and shuts down before you could finish orders",

    "content": "Great game! The only merge game I know that has devices(like the grill and juicer) to actually make food out of the merged items. Orders are fun, not too hard, at least till my level. I like how there's so many different kinds of events and that they have actually different mechanics, not just merge. A lot happens at once, so that stresses me out and a lot of the times I have to ignore them. The number of pop-up ads gets annoying and sometimes overwhelming. Lot of fun overall, though.",

I miss what the game used to be. we have gotten some quality of life upgrades but now the game seems to be more about money than ever before. edit: I'm done with the game. no longer fun",

THANK YOU ❤️ definitely deserve the 5 stars I have played this game since 2023 & this game has been my fav game, one of the games that stayed the longest time in my phone. I even played it everyday since the first time i installed it. Unfortunately, the new update doesn't have the watch ads option to gain more energy/accelerate cooking time/gain stuff from bubble thingy. It disappoints me so much that i have to pay/use diamonds in order to get all of those :)",

Unless I am ready to spend an enormous amount of money to keep the game going, it is best that I delete this app. Update: I did not delete the app. The game is still fun and tedious. Now the ad perks are gone. I can no longer watch an ad to get extra energy, to double my daily deals, to clear the bubbles for an item etc. I need this fixed.",

    "content": "I am giving this a 1 star now!! previously, it would have been a 5. I went to play this morning & they have taken away the free lives I could get by watching adverts & they have also taken away the daily free items you could also get by watching free adverts. It has ruined the enjoyment of the game, and I did spend real money on it which I do feel I should now request a refund for every £ I have spent on it. I will never spend another £ on this game!!",

No annoying pop up ads either, you only have to watch them to get extra energy points or bonus",

I am building up cooking boosts and generator boosts but can't use them because the main limiter is energy. while I'm glad there are no pop up ads I would gladly opt in to watching an ad to gain more energy",

Example being, right when you open the game you get like 3-4 pop ups asking you to spend money on energy or gems with the lie that their \"100%\" off. It makes the game really unbearable. Not to mention the events! Too many! And forces you to participate somehow before leaving you alone, I hate the food race! Not to mention the game crashing! It closes out randomly!",

    "content": "Well, the game glitches often. I purchased twice or so and it didn't work. When I contacted the developer, no response. Not worth it. Edit: They finally responded. If you present your issues to them, there are a few copy paste messages they use and then apologose for being unable to help you further because their policy doesn't allow to do so. So, again, not worth it. Please don't make any purchases because if you lose the progress through some glitch, they won't assist you with a refund.",

Many perks have been taken away, the generators have to recharge more quickly than before, for many orders it takes a couple of days to complete unless you spend money. I will not support a developer who blatantly forces users into spending money to continue playing!",

It would be so much better if they didn't pop up constantly but instead gave little notification bubbles on the little side icons. Other than that this is a great game.",

It frequently felt like you needed to spend money to continue playing, and it took longer and longer to get to the final product - sometimes taking about 500+ energy! The final straw came today. It suddenly made my phone shut down without warning. Then after restarting, the game was stuck loading at 69%. I'm no longer able to play. Why?",

    "content": "I absolutely love this game but it's been increasingly getting frustrating. I've been playing for over a year, daily, and really enjoying it but recently the app keeps crashing moments after the loading screen finishes. The app also crashes when I sometimes double, with an ad, the reward and when I go back in it doesn't give me my reward after I watched the whole ad. Other than the crashes I really enjoy the game and plan on playing it as long as I can open it.",

It's a huge setback, and it happened right after I spent 20$ on the game. I told myself I'd quit this game so many times already. Overall, I do not recommend (anymore).",

It feels like I'm being punished for making the purchases. I will not spend anymore on this game and will most likely uninstall soon.",

But I've tried, and I dont know how to restore it. I really don't know what to do, and I don't want to start over. Is there a way I can restore my data?",

Second, it throws stupid bubbles on the board that you can only wait a minute to go away or use gems. It's annoying to wait a full minute to play again.",
