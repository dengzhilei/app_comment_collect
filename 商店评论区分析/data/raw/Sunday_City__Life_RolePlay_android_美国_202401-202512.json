I also can't even do the ads because they don't give a way to exit them. they just pop to the download page and then I go back to the game and don't get any credit for it. along with if you wanted to share with a friend to make it more fun. you don't get credit when you share.",

    "content": "This game is another P2W. Instead of working it revolves around the casino. You can't work unless you gamble at the casino? After opening your second business it costs $260k to clean up the floor and stuff. It's multiple things that cost a fortune and it tries to force you into buying stuff. I'd say this game has potential but the jobs and casino aspect ruin the game. Sadly this is what mobile games have become. Just pay to win and no actual fun.",

Then I could start a family in the game. 95 out of 100. Also your coins for spins never run out if you never do a high bet.",

The only thing i don't like is the very high fees to open your businesses .What each business generates each hour is not equal to what you pay to open them . Very low return profit and you only get profits for 1 businesses at a time every hour . By the way Sunday city has no residents besides the players. So no one will be at the houses when you deliver whatever. It's still an wonderful game.",

I mean only chips that you get overtime increase. The whole base needs update just to let a player have a chance to keep up with spendings. I mean to open/upgrade/hire staff prices keep increasing. While to make that money you spend more at casino but rewards are way too small all around the base of the game.",

What makes it harder is that you need to depend on luck only with casino. the income grows very slow while everything goes expensive very fast. its getting harder and eventually you have to buy with real money for things to work. sometimes even with real money still doesnt help much.",

The casino being the main focus of the game causes us to need chips to make money, and upgrade the businesses which allows us to level up. Ar some point in the game you may run low on chips. Agreeing with others here, investing real money for casino chips can get expensive. Seeing that earning money is easier, I thought it would be useful if you guys could create an option where we could trade money 💵 for casino chips.",

    "content": "Just a casino simulator. The focus isn't on grinding your job, it's literally just gambling. You even have to gamble just to get \"job tokens\" to be allowed to work. There is close to no interactivity with other players as there is just nothing to do together. You can randomly ride in a car together or participate in the yoga thing, but that's about it. This is clearly focused on in-app-purchases and the casino itself. That's the whole game.",

I do wish achieving slot coins was more easier because most rewards is money also how long it takes just to get a different avatar or a nice car is really long. There is also no reason to clearly emphasize a girls butt as the game photo, extremely perverted and disgusting and i feel is the opposite of clickbait.",

    "content": "I believe this could be more. Its a good game to pass time but can get boring quickly. You're just \"gambling\" and working multiple jobs to earn money for businesses you can really interact with. You have to spend money to hire and \"train\" staff but the staff doesn't do anything and you can't interact with them. Plus you hire about 4-6 ppl and only see one. Its the same money opportunities everyday, it gets boring. The only leisure is the ferris wheel. Can't visit other businesses, eat, nothing.",

    "content": "my honest review. I liked this game, especially the casino. what I don't like is that you can't grind without spending. once you have finished all your task, you need to wait for it to refresh and basically nothing else to do except chatting and going around the city doing nothing. so, I quit the game and play again once it refreshes. being away from the game for a couple of times tends to bore people. u need something to keep your player in or risk losing player overtime. let say a dead city.",

Where the scale is off, is $100 irl doesn’t even get you $10M in game. This game, while fun, is strictly Pay to Win.

It's fun when you get other nearby players to join your minigames. And the open world aspect of it is really neat. However, most players look the same as there are very little style options.

While you build your business empire, you got to play in the Casino, Dig Treasures, do yoga, deliver mails, collect trash, post posters, and more to be able to earn money. I wish they could utilize the village portion so houses there can be functional. It could be someone's \"HOME\" for personal space and parties! 🎉",

    "content": "Lack of customization options. You can't freely customize your character or your businesses Overall game play is boring. Having to spend time in a Casino to launder the chips from your business into cash doesn't make sense it's just a cool down mechanic that tries to hide the grind. But it's worse than having a construction timer because there's always a chance that you won't win anything in the Casino slowing down your progress even more. Not a great game",

    "content": "Decent game, but could be much better with things like building and decorating your own home, more character appearance choices etc. Also it's really hard to progress without spending money... to open, upgrade businesses, then train staff cost way to much money, you can only do events once a day, and trying to get new cards to complete sets seems almost impossible after 60% completion. Could be great, just needs more development and fairer game play. Please keep this ad free, love that part",

    "content": "I love the no ads. but you guys made the game so expensive. It looks like a fun game. and it is fun until you have to grind it out everyday. Just to build a business. so no ads ='s 5 mins a day play time. can you lower the prices and give more stuff to do. For an example. Just to finish the 3rd business costs àlot almost a week to finish it or more then millions to train staff. Also shouldn't you be able to do tasks in each job you own. Or festival stuff not just 1 a day. be better then Sims",

It revolves around a few glorified slot machines in the center of a boring open world designed to drain your bank account. It does not feel like a life sim. Your businesses, avatars and outfits are all crafted for you. You currently have no house, cannot choose where items go, nor customize or interact with them. Everywhere you look, it's just an illusion of choice and a microtransaction. Disgustingly shameful business model.",

It's basically just playing slots for cash to \"build\" up your business that you can't even choose, customize, or interact with, then you move on to the next one. The \"jobs\" are just tasks you do like putting up flyers so you can earn chips to play at the casino. You can't even really customize your character. Everything is preset and needs to be unlocked. There's hardly anything in the \"world\" to interact with. The nerve to call this a life sim.",

    "content": "The graphics are good, but the gameplay is very monotonous and lacks activity. Your daily job is simply to play at the casino and earn money to build your business. The city also feels very empty due to the lack of NPCs. And most importantly, there are no daily quests to motivate us to keep playing longer.",

    "content": "Super chill game. It's like GTA but a Sims versions which is refreshing. would be really cool if we can buy our own house with options and freely decorate them inside and out. I believe a couple of NPC's should be added to the game walking around, sitting down, running, driving. It adds to the liveliness of the game because while the city looks amazing visually, it lacks some some of action and jusy makes it's somewhat depressing in a way. Overall love the game,can't wait for what's to come next",

Missing opportunity to sell skins/add to packs. I think a voice chat feauture would be a great addition, & Dance/emote gestures, RP events 4 community",

Also, there's alot of children on the game, although the game is an 18+, it's full of underage kids. I can't block them, only mute them for so many hours. It's annoying and grosses me out.",

I enjoy the low key community interactions, and I'd like to see more actions with the world.

Winning 10 million in the casino is not enough. and you hire the staff for more than 10 million and the return would only be 12k chips and hour. The game has potential but it's way greedy.",

Also wish there were other ways of making my main income without it being casino gambling. Pretty much everything revolves around casino so I hope there's another way in the future like doing jobs.

I also like the gift boxes with money and coins, but would be great if you had a countincluded to show how many out of total you found so far. it's a good start but would be great to see how it develops. edit- game deleted",

I made a purchase in the game almost 5 days ago, and i did not receive my items, and it is yet to be rectified as it takes nearly 24 hours for somebody to actually respond. Will not be making any in-game purchases in the future.",

So if you want a game to sink some time into on an evening, I wouldn't choose this as you will run out and have to wait, unless you spend real cash. The overall aesthetic of the game is fun, but you can't do jobs until you've earnt the points to do them. Probably won't play this for much longer.",

It needs for player to be able to interact with eachother like shaking hands or hugging & the environment like the chairs 2. It needs housing system where u can buy & decorate or build ur own house 3. Games for players to play together & fishing There can be more but these are the basics for now Thank You for the beatiful game & wish u the best from Egypt 🇪🇬 ❤️",

I was getting 460k from my business' to 180 and the free chips from 150k to 36k and took away the exchange for cash to chips? Yet theres no other business or anything to do and then you change the no chips from the casino? I have to much cash and less chips to gain. This honestly sucks",

They'll lose players and I personally will not be spending a single penny from now on",

    "content": "The game is fun but a little redundant not much diversity in the sense character customization or being able to own a home and customize it , it should be more open world in these aspects , invite friends to home , shops etc. instead of the same thing over , gamble , tasks , repeat . I love that it's online open world but need more realisticness in a sense I can customize my character, home, profile picture etc add some of these I'll update my review ! Very fun so far though.",
