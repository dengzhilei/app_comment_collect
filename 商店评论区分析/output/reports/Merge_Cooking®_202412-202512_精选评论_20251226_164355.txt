Nice relaxing game that you dont have to pay to enjoy, ads are optional for bonus extras. My only issue is anytime an event comes around (cycled through the same things pretty regularly) you are forced every time to be shown what to do, theres an option to look at how to play that pops up, I think it should be left at that, especially with how many things pop up as you are playing anyway. Just frustrating sometimes when I already know what to do but forced to go through it again and again.

For current update: PLEASE let us have the option of changing graphics, and what help it displays. the new update, which added a symbol of what things can be added to dishes to complete them is ruining the flow of the game. I have played for hundreds of hours, I know how to check what is needed! I am merging for different things! let me have the option to turn it off! the game is fun, but each new update that adds help is actually barring me from playing well.

fun game. the themed generators are very unhelpful though, uneven split for food to items  takes too long as it generates the stuff you dont need. British one generates 17 foodberries to 3 items. should be closer to a 5050 split  shouldnt need to buy so many diamonds to avoid getting stuck on 1 order and miss out on all the mini games during the week. update: themed generators have improved a lot making the game more enjoyable.

Game needs improvement. you get to a certain point where all orders are super high level items and it makes game play progress slowly. generators dont get phased out you just add to them so the board is half full of them and the equipment. game was fun at first but now its stalled and without spending a ton of money on gems its hard to get further in.

I have played this game for months and enjoyed it immensely. However, this latest update has taken away the option to watch ads for energy except for once a day. I used to be able to get more energy every hour or so. this has made it so that I can only play for a couple minutes at a time. This is boring and I am rapidly losing interest. Response: umm, no. The availability of ads is not the problem. The problem is that there are not enough opportunities to watch the ads and that is on you.

Okay, new review, still love this game and it was added that you can now use ads instead of diamonds for generator which is nice, however I still have a possibily unpopular opinion lol, it would be nice if there was an option to opt out of stuff like the burger tower race and flash food race, Im probably one of the only people who do this but I have multiple generator peices that I cant get more peices for cuz Im always thrown into things I dont care about, an option to not do it would be nice

great game! well designed, nice side quests, lets you watch ads for bonuses, but you arent forced to watch ads. I appreciate how developers listen to feedback! still not a fan of the repeated popups and the lack of transparency with pricing, but not huge factors for game play. I wish the app wouldnt stop outside media from playing while i use the app. the app doesnt necessitate sound, so let me listen to my music!

with the most recent update the green help cards are gone. now you have to go into each recipe and see what items are needed. please bring back the help cards. Generators need to load increases as you level up, and it is very annoying to have to wait or watch a 70second ad just to obtain 5 items to be able to merge 2 fruits. Just let the generators be if the energy is available. Also, provide the option to pop the balloons instead of them taking up space on the board.

Why are you suddenly being so stingy on the card packs? It used to be just about doable to complete an album but the last two you changed the card pack challenges to only have 5 packs at level 10 instead of level 5 as well and its very difficult to reach level 10 in one day even watching the max amount of ads playable. re: your response  you should reward loyalty not make it harder, whats the point in sticking around  watching the full gamut of ads if it doesnt get you anything?

first the lighting bolts take too long to regenerate. it should only take 60secs . an to make an item you have to merge too many things and you dont even have enough lighting to finish one order cause one item from one order takes it all. I understand that you need to make money on these games by people buying stuff to get further but damn make it a little easier for us to progress without having to spend so much and you dont even get any things worth paying for.

Ive played this game for like a few years now. I really enjoy it and thats why I definitely dont want to uninstall it yet. Lately the game has been lagging and crashing and its the only game on my phone that does that. A few days ago it only crashed when I tried to watch an add but now its just random. Can you do something about it please  ? (Also, do you have any control on the adds that play ? There is one with spiders that really bothers me and I cant even signal as disagreeable.)

I discovered this game through the Fetch app, where you can earn points by playing certain games. I quickly fell in love with this game. However, Ive noticed a couple things that would improve gameplay. When generators run out of energy, it would be nice to have an actual minutesecond timer on when they regain energy. Also, how many energy clicks you have left on generators would be helpful. One more addition would be the option to undo an accidental merge.

Fun game, but it has become tedious and boring. Too much repetition to get the next item or the catalyst for the next item or the cooking appliances. Unless I am ready to spend an enormous amount of money to keep the game going, it is best that I delete this app. Update: I did not delete the app. The game is still fun and tedious. Now the ad perks are gone. I can no longer watch an ad to get extra energy, to double my daily deals, to clear the bubbles for an item etc. I need this fixed.

used to really enjoy this game. the ads that helped boost cooking time and energy really balanced how much you do or dont want to spend while you play. unfortunately as of the latest update there are zero ad options. cant watch anything to boost the energy, no ads to speed up cooking, nothing. not sorry no ad available, there literally isnt even the option to watch an advert. either this is a bug or the developers are trying to rinse anyone who is usually free to play on this game.

Ill try and summarise all negative reviews : You cant watch ads anymore to get free stuff and energy. The generators after use, they take up half of storing space without the option to remove them. When you need one specific ingredient or item, the algorithm gives you 90 of everything else depleting your energy. Congratulations. You took a fun game and made it a soulless greedy mess. And no devs, ads didnt disappear because of regional blah blah. You just want to take our money

My main complaint is with the multiplier. Why am I still getting level 1 items while using a 4x energy boost? If I need a level 1 ingredient, Im perfectly capable of turning the boost off to get that level 1 item. Reply to devs: They drop repeatedly, not only if I dont currently have the level 1 item. It happens after Ive completed the dish, and until the entire order is filled. I wish it only did it as needed, but thats not the case. Make it work the way you claim, then Ill give 5 stars

Not sure why the watch ads to get free stuff and the spend diamonds to get diamonds features were taken away but those need to come back! Ive tried over a dozen merge games this year and this one is my favorite by far. Its the only one that I play every day. But taking those features away severely limits my gameplay. Also, a players max energy should increase with their level. Im at Level 63 and its a little crippling to be limited to 100 energy. Now I must spend  or wait hours to play

I like this game. Ive been playing for a while (now level 73) and want to keep going. But Im pretty disappointed in the most recent changes, not because of the changes but the absence of any update or communication. I just read the developers comment to a recent review that the changes are to improve gameplay and that whole components will be given out. But what about all the parts still in inventory? I havent truly made extra room, have I? Theyre still sitting there. Now useless?

by level 4 I know what im doing. the hand holding is absurd! this is a toddlers game not for adults they are making that quite clear by telling me what to do after level 3! I love merge games but not ones that MAKE me do what they say I SHOULD do I know how to play . if I want to go home using the home  button you provided, let me go there. no they demand u click on a certain spot up top. not just a suggestion. but a constant push. not my type of game. if its not urs dont waste time

OBSESSED and addicted to this game! Ive been playing for 1.5yrs, this is my all time favorite mobile game ever! Graphics are great, its complex where you make dishes from merged ingredients for customers, which makes it more engaging than regular merge games. You can watch short ads to get energy points every few hours so its easy to build energy points, so you never need to pay money to advance far. No annoying pop up ads either, you only have to watch them to get extra energy points or bonus

I love this game. it is simple and fun I am very busy so I dont have a lot of time to play games. this is great for a few minutes of break time I get in a day. only problem I am having is that I cant watch ads to get extra stuff. dont mind watching a few to move along but the option to watch isnt even there. dont spend real money on games often but I would spend a few dollars on this one if I didnt feel forced to. give me the option to watch videos and I will be more likely to spend also

ive been playing this for almost one year now and I really love it as im someone who loves cooking and different types of cuisines. but I noticed that the games features arent same for everyone. I tried updating but nothing changed. for some people so many features are available to make the game pretty fun and easy , also interesting, but its getting kinda hard to play as we level up. its fun but I suggest u guyz give us more free energy even if its by watching ads. so please consider...

Just another game of merging and cooking to complete quests and build. Pretty boring. Have energy, can watch ads to refill baskets. Bug where settings icon is. Repeatly says ! new avatar but there isnt a new one. Ive seen them all. Graphics are plain and boring, not very detailed, but easy to understand. Not too many ads. Ads are optional to earn things. Better than most merge games Ive tried. Cant choose how you want to design things.

I started playing a couple of months ago, and while its been fun, its become more obvious that this game is rigged to get you to spend more money. For example, all I need is a measly Cauliflower, WHY AM I GETTING MINIMAL INGREDIENTS TO MERGE FOR IT??!! Nothing but cucumbers and tomatoes??! Ive never got an option for ads for anything (which could help), but I digress. Again, its been fun, but I had to uninstall to protect my wallet lol. ETA: and for that weird response, 1 star

Ok changing my ratings and reviews cause I just noticed some of negatives! 1 The game does not support microphone so any music stops once you run it. 2 the x2 reward for star chest does not double the energy. 3 Flash food race is not evenly distributed cause Im on level 148 so its hard for me to complete orders on time especially with the motorcyle items i.e leather wallet,Pinocchio toy and pasta molds which are the most needed. 4 again please have Google as a way of saving progress too!

Ive been playing this game for awhile now and I love it so much. Its my top played game on my phone the only issue Ive been having is when I go to watch an add to get a reward it keeps saying ADD NOT AVAILABLE and its been saying that for like a week and half now. I didnt know if it was just me or not but its becoming an issue now because I cant do anymore progress without having to buy something to continue my game at my speed

Ive seen other reviews about having the option to watch ads for more energy, but I have never had that option. I have verified that I am on the latest update, restarted my phone, and even tried on both wifi and data. Never had the option. This game would be much more fun if there was an option for more energy without spending real money, otherwise, it comes off as a blatant cash grab.

The monitisation model is getting more obvious and plainly ugly at this point. Orders that requires high level generator items come up too often and the generator gives stinchy amounts every generation. It force you to watch ad and even worse spend on finishing that recipe otherwise you cant finish other seasonal events because you are stuck not earning enough coins to unlock event rewards as no new recipes will come up before that. Wish I can give it another chance but seems hopeless.

used to love this game, BUTIve been playing this game for months and Im over level 100, I really enjoyed the game and thought that watching ads was fair because we could get energy or rewards instead. But after some updates the option to watch ads was limited, so unfortunately theres not much fun playing the game anymore because it takes days to finish some tasks, thats really disappointing and I get why more and more people delete the game now. Not sure if developers would listen

A well balanced game that is fun to played and very competitive in trying to merge the items together. The Mimi games are also fun and competitive as well with there game. One setback is that you cant sell everything and might have to trashed it. Another setback is merge the required items to cook or gather the items together. It might also take awhile in getting materials need to build the item thats been requested by the person. Like that there is no time clock in the game. It froze up.

Dear team, I am reaching out here after no luck flagging by mail twice. First of all, thank you for keeping us, players, entertained! The game is great and has so far earned my 5 stars. However, I am a few days down from playing after updating to version 1.1.91. I have in my todo list to serve German Snow White Cake but the same ingredients go with Black Forest cake and I cannot continue with the order. Hope it will be resolved very soon! :)

I like the premise of the game  the graphics (unlike other merge games Im actually excited to merge to unlock new recipes), but the main limit is the amount of energy this always runs out quickly  there are no ad options or minigames to help gain more energy, so I just have to wait. I am building up cooking boosts and generator boosts but cant use them because the main limiter is energy. while Im glad there are no pop up ads I would gladly opt in to watching an ad to gain more energy

Soooo good. I really like this game. I play alot of different merge games, but what i really enjoy on this one is that you can cook, grill, or squeeze fruits and make drinks. My favorite part is designing and rebuilding, aside from reading the story. The graphics are a big thing for me. I love the colors and the cute graphs. Its captivating and intriguing and I wanna just keep and keep playing. I almost didnt try it because I already have enough games but honestly Im so glad I gave this a try.

Ive played this for a while now, close to 5 or 6 years. I really like that ads are only an option and not forced, and the perks are worth having to watch it. I dont like that I cant access old mini games and work towards completing those portions of the game, so I hope they bring those back at some point. Very engaging, lots to do daily, and enough energy supplied (with multiplier options) to get it done in. Repeated tutorials are annoying, but overall, it is a very good game.

the game is great but, the level of give me your money, all the time is a little exhausting. if you could make it similar or an option to not use real world money like for kids that would be great. its not like the ads but similar. I have to put it down a lot because the generators dont have a long life or you run out of energy quick some times, but its a good match game.

Ive been playing this game for about 2 years now (maybe more), and I do spend a little money, but I was disappointed to see all of my bonuses and daily deals disappear. I can not access the things I can get by watching a video. I love this game, but after the last update, its becoming very annoying to have to wait so long to complete an item, and I am not willing to spend a lot more on this game. This is my stress relief after a long day at work, and I really enjoy the game, but its insane

Was super fun. since the last update, you dont get items to upgrade generators as you complete one order, it waits until you complete 7. They also used to add more orders if you were stuck on one order due to a higher level item, however this has also been taken away.

Its a fun distraction. The only thing I dont like is how long it takes for the generators to power back up. I suppose thats done on purpose to make people feel like they NEED to spend money on gems to speed up the process. I get that you want to make money so getting people addicted to winning these little side quests and getting bonuses and stuff gets the job done. but speeding up the generators just a nudge wouldnt hurt.

I liked this game a lot...at first. The graphics were great, the progression was interesting. However after a couple of months, ads started being unavailable. It frequently felt like you needed to spend money to continue playing, and it took longer and longer to get to the final product  sometimes taking about 500 energy! The final straw came today. It suddenly made my phone shut down without warning. Then after restarting, the game was stuck loading at 69. Im no longer able to play. Why?

I used to play all the time but the game has changed so much and gotten rid of old things for new things. all the old stuff Ive collected is useless. and now theres nothing I can do but wait for these dang autodump generators to charge since it needs the highest leveled items for each new batch of orders. I miss what the game used to be. we have gotten some quality of life upgrades but now the game seems to be more about money than ever before. edit: Im done with the game. no longer fun

Where have all the perks gone? No more diamond carnival? Earning a set amount of stars only gives you 25 energy instead of 50? No more 8 cards? Ive spent a lot of time and a decent amount of money on this game, but as more and more perks disappear, my desire to continue playing goes with it. Edit to add: Rating bumped up to reflect developers comment. Game is incredibly fun at the start, but frustrating after Lvl 100 without the benefits mentioned above. Excited to see what comes later.

Fun for a bit, but then the items you need to make get so long and complicated there is absolutely no way you can make progress without having to watch ads every minute, and even then the number of ads is limited so you have to pay to play. Plus the items you can buy are so expensive wdym 100 energy cost goes from 10 to 20 to 80 gems and even that only allows you to complete like 15 of a single order Frustrating... Deleted

The game is addictive, like most of this kind. I even bought a few items to be able to play more, however it looks like the game is not random at all. Lets say that one producer creates items X and Y. Normally its producing around 5050 of each if you need them both, but as soon as you only need only X, it will be producing 80 of Y and only 20 of X. It feels like Im being punished for making the purchases. I will not spend anymore on this game and will most likely uninstall soon.

I would enjoy this if it wasnt for the constant prompts. It dictates how you move through the game, which I hate. I had to uninstall this after 20 minutes as the hand and dictation was so irritating  I wish they would get rid of it. Constantly pointing at what to dowhich move to make. It would be nice if the hand was removed to allow the player to play the game.

I used to love this game, but over time, not only have some of the perks disappeared, but, with this new update, you can no longer trade items youve made for energy, meaning that, if you want to actually play the game for more than 2 minutes at a time every 3 hours or so (because thats how long it takes to replenish your energy from 0), you have no other choice but to spend A LOT of money, especially in the later levels. Game used to be fun, now its just like every other cash grab out there.

How did you mess up your game? Ive been playing this game because I love it so much. But now, you only give 1 energy per 3 minutes, and when it reaches 100, it doesnt increase anymore. With just 100 energy, I cant even complete a single order. Your game has become so boring now. Its really disappointing. I uninstalled your game today. My suggestion is: You should increase the energy limit from 100to 1000. Im from Myanmar . Im still learning English, so please bear with me .

I have played this game for years at this point and spent a fair amount of money on it. and I just truly wish that the devs just stopped making this actually decent game so difficult and annoying to use! why is 13 of my time playing waiting for and clicking off incessant pop ups? why is everything flashing and yelling at me the whole time? why does it feel like the devs dont even want me to enjoy playing their game? its a great game if you didnt make it so irritating!!

Well I have never had the option to watch ads. Ive only been playing for a couple of months and have spent too much money already tbh. I like the game and I have never played games on my phone before the past few months. But it is becoming draining to wait so long to complete one order without paying. I refuse to pay anymore then I already have. Give your users more energy, its not like youre not making enough money off us all anyways. DATA alone isnt free. we pay every month for it.

UPDATE . Ive given you 5 stars for the update on extra space for the generators and more !! I really enjoy this game so Im feeling very grateful I never deleted the game and stayed patient for this awesome update . thank you so much. great game only reason why I give 3 stars is because of space , there should be extra storage space for generators and things like that . the lack of space gets frustrating . its not challenging, its frustrating. but otherwise great game

the game is fun, you can play without purchasing anything, however it takes longer to complete orders that way, I have also noticed that deliberately, the item generators give the wrong items needed to complete an order so that your energy is depleted and you are forced to buy boosters or else wait hours for your generators to charge up again, which is frustrating, if you need to make money as an app, you dont need to make it unnecessarily annoying to the point can only play the game twice aday

The game is very fun and I like the fact that you have to actually cook certain dishes  like assembling different parts with different cooking devices. edit: pleasantly surprised to see that the developers listened to feedback! now old generators that have no use occupy a different storage, which is so much better! it would be nice for it to count towards rarer equipment as well (e.g the ice cream machine that not many recipes use).

Ive played this game since 2022 and its one of the best merge games. However, with the recent updates, the game lose its attractiveness. Everything needs gems, no more ads option to get items and energy. I know that the developer needs to earn money somehow, but its such a turn off to get rid of the optional ads completely. Ive stopped playing since then.

Well, the game glitches often. I purchased twice or so and it didnt work. When I contacted the developer, no response. Not worth it. Edit: They finally responded. If you present your issues to them, there are a few copy paste messages they use and then apologose for being unable to help you further because their policy doesnt allow to do so. So, again, not worth it. Please dont make any purchases because if you lose the progress through some glitch, they wont assist you with a refund.

Ive played this game for almost a year now. Really liked how I could play it offline and there werent pop up ads when I do play online. In fact, I almost always played online and watched ads for rewards. As for the actual gameplay, its fun! There were always many events that gave nice rewards. And then games art quality changed and it became more obviously AI. Its glossy and ugly and I dislike it. I couldnt even play offline anymore. Its sad but Ive uninstalled this now.

Cute visuals and fun, a great timekiller. BUT there are way too many side games and constant popups asking you to buy stuff. Energy runs out fast, so unless youre willing to sit through casino ads and backtoback promos, playtime stays super short.

Ive been playing for about a month now. The energy cap is annoying, but its a game that I play a few times a day. I think there must have been an update in the last week. I am extremely pleased with the new option to watch ads for energy and to speed up the timers. I ignore most of the mini rounds. I cant opt out and thats annoying. The only negative is the massive amount of BUY THIS BUNDLE ads. 5 or 6 before I can even start playing. All in all a decent game. Stay casual, give it a try!

Im hooked on this game and play every day. However, its getting frustrating because the level that Im at obviously comes with harder recipes that take ingredients that require a lot of energy. I wish they would increase the base line of energy from 100 as you level up. I do appreciate the new ways to earn energy through the cards and side games. This week Ive encountered a new issue. It only let me watch ads for energy like 5 ads and it never regenerates for 24 hrs! So I cant get energy

Just like any other merge games, I think. Ive been playing few merge games and I need to say this is quite good since it had a different mechanism. We need to cook something and its quite a fun addition. However, its still not worth it. The amount of energy used to finish one order is OUTRAGEOUS. They were basically forcing us to watch ads or if you dont want to, buy their discount packs. I bought some, but its not enough. I regretted my purchase honestly. 2 stars.

Game is too low on energy. By the time one gets the item you need at higher levels it just feels like a pay to win game. Theres should be more to do while you wait. I guess youre trying to get us to pay money, but honestly, it gets to be no fun anymore when you feel like you need to purchase things every 5 minutes. Also the increased rate and prices of packages after youve purchased once is disgusting. You do not get your moneys worth.

I have been playing this game for quite a while now. I really appreciate that it does not force ads on you. It does prompt you to buy things constantly however. The game is entertaining but I would say its best for people who have patience. I let things cook and return to the game after my energy refills. My biggest gripe is that it takes forever to make some high level items. As you progress into the later levels this becomes more and more egregious. You make the same high level items often.

Casual merge game with restoration story meta layer. Aside from all the familiar components, the cooking mechanic actually feels new, but does nothing more than adding another timer to the core gameplay loop. If you are into relaxing but mindless time wasters youll find this one more polished, but also more expensive to progress than other titles in its genre.

The game and the ad did not align. You have to generate items before you can merge them and some items take way too long to merge. The board is filled with your generators leaving very little room to make your items. Rewards disappear very close to when youre about to earn them and reappear when the time has run out for the event. Support does not respond. You have to pay to play if you want to enjoy the game otherwise its a whole lot of waiting. Some people get features some dont.

The automatic generators need an upgrade. They only give a handful of items every 2,5 hours. Ive been unable to play for days, stuck on a last order that requires the highest level of an item from one of those generators. Watching ads to speed it up is useless, the ads never load and it takes two of them to reload the generator to 50 of its capacity.

Its okay but theres too many tutorials that you cant skip. It holds your hand to do the new features. Its also a money sink; if you ever want to complete the special events, you need to buy the extra diamonds and energy or else you will never ever be able to finish them on time. It takes too long to replenish energy and running out of energy happens so much; you have no shot at full game wo paying a subscription service via micro transactions. Sucks bc this is a great game otherwise!

Gave this a 5 so people can see this review. This game got no ads for F2P option when u need boosters. Everything is to be paid for, or you wait. Which was fine for me, until they added a small update, where if you mergeproduce an unrelated item and each time it will asks you this item is not ordered by anyone, are you sure you want to make it?. What exactly is the point of playing this if the game try to stop you from doing anything per click??

I really enjoy playing this game to relax, and am happy just merging and discovering new dishesparticipating in events. What I dont love is that the daily rewards tree and multiple opportunities to get more energy during the day by watching ads have both seemingly been removed? Those features made the game accessible for those of us who cant spend money on a phone game. Bring them back, please. Edit: Not changing my rating, in fact Im lowering it, as the points made above were ignored.

Im disabled and on a fixed income, there is no way that I will be paying to play this game. I really enjoyed the game so I will be sad to see it go. If you cant get ad revenue, that sucks, but expecting players to spend money every time they turn around is not sustainable.

Ive been playing this game for a few years, and its still one of my favorites. The reason Im giving 2 stars is because a few times now I have watched videos to get rewards like energy, but after the ad stops I dont get any rewards. This game also makes it impossible to contact anyone regarding lost rewards. Very upsetting. Adding this part to respond to the developers response. I have sent screenshots to your support email on numerous occasions. Ive never received any response.

This game makes itself unplayable. you open it up and have to go through 1015 popups that you have to sit through the entire animation of. you have to wait for an animation to start, then when you click X you have to wait for the closing animation and then you can continue. it also stops any music or anything youre listening to after every ad, every pop up, even if the game is muted. I dont have enough characters to continue with everything wrong with this game

not a bad game overall (which I am using because of freecash) but I wish the cooldowns were shorter on generators, and there was an option to watch ads for rewards, especially energy like other merge games. other than that its been a bit more interesting in gameplay compared to those

I really recommend this game. Why it is different from other merge games is that they keep adding possibilities how to get stuff for free. When I started playing in December, nothing was free (like in every game, they arent nonprofit). But than they add possibility to watch adds (only if you choose to watch, otherwise there are no forced adds at all). And now they changed an event in a way, that what I get for free is 3 times more. So I even spent some money. Thank you for this direction

Up until the last update, which took out ad based rewards, it was pretty perfect. This WAS my favorite mobile game  I spent an ungodly amount of time playing. That included watching over 15min of adsday to get all the rewards. I even spent money, which I dont do. Ive never spent this much time on a game, so Im really disappointed. The removal of ads has made events unwinnable, progress slow,  free premium currency is gone. Its sad the devs care so little for their current player base.

Good Game But Beware Alot of fun but mini games are not completable unless you spend money for extras. I enjoyed the game played alot until it took for 6,99 and 150 tries to get a ice cube and believe me it did. Once you spend money they got you and they will keep raising the prices on you so please becareful. it all adds up and after you see the total you spent was it that much fun. I will say it is enjoyable in the beginning and everything seems to fall into place. But then WOW!!!!

Ive been using this game to calm down for months,  have loved it. Im absolutely gutted that, in what must be the last update, theyve stopped rewarding each order with parts of equipment. This is making the game almost unplayable without paying, as the storage  board are so loaded up with parts that its near impossible to make certain items without either deleting hardearned ingredients, or equipment (or paying). Its so disheartening when games do this.

It was once an amazing game, however, recently it did not let me watch ads to get free energy anymore. Since my level is higher now, I really need energy to complete my orders. In the past, it was a little easier for me to get it done because of free ads. Now, it becomes impossible if I dont want to spend money. So disappointed. I uninstalled this game yesterday and never want to play this moneygame anymore.

Fun game that has no ads but I wish it didnt make you play some of the extra games and features. Ill be focused on one taskgames and it will force you to play other games. It wont allow you to exit until you tap everything it says to continue. Other than that its very addictive and great way to pass time.

I like merge games, and the complexity of having to make the recipes too makes the concept of this game better than other merge games. However, because generators spit out other things that you might not need at random, the board fills up quickly, and obtaining gems is so far and few between that you cant buy enough extra slots to make up for the amount of space you need. Also, the cool down for generators is WAY too long

I would have rated this game 5 stars just for how long Ive been playing and enjoying it. However, Ive noticed that ads are consistently glitching and not providing promised rewards, despite watching all the way through. With the recent update, this happens 50 of the time and it makes watching ads for rewards feel useless. Along with this, many perks and activities have been removed or changed to lesser rewards over time.

Its a fun game, although my complain is that its getting significantly difficult on higher level and you need spending gems or watch many ads to finish just an order. I think its more fair and interesting, if we get higher level equipment rewards the higher level we are in. Im in a place where its very difficult to continue the game in a fun way.

This is the most frustrating mobile game I have played in a long time. I have played so many mobile games. However, merge cooking has this annoying habit of telling you exactly what to do every second of the game I feel like Im going crazy. Not to mention you run out of energy super quickly. Everything feels unfun to play. The game looks nice and has very attractive art but the game mechanics are so unfun it makes me angry. It is just a poorly designed mobile game.

Yesterdays update has interfered with the ability to play ads to unlock items or speed up time. It generates the error message No ad available iirc, but if you close the app and restart the an ad will play once and then disappear, giving the same error message. Sometimes  rarely  no ad will play at all but you get the reward after a little while. Completely broken, about to uninstall cause you need those ads to play.

As much as I really did love this game, especially when I first started playing it, I spent and on average am spending way too much money to actually play it and stay involved in it. The freebies are below mediocre. This is the type of game where you just log in and play for like 2 minutes and then thats it, until you get more energy and that takes awhile. there has been zero benefit to my commitment or money I have spent. its fun, but there are too many competitors out there.

I really enjoy this game, but I was unable to pick up where I left off after getting a new phone. I ended up starting over because I had always really liked the game, but I was disappointed they had changed it where you could no longer watch ads for items, and the only way to get them was to spend money. It looks like they changed it back where you can watch ads for items again, so I have updated my review. I am glad they listened to the players and changed it back before I uninstalled it.

2.75. A bit better than some other paytoprogress games I have tried, potentially intriguing. But probably the main annoyingstingy thing is the slow and impotent generators, and even if I try to give it a boost, it only lasts another 10 or so taps. This mightnt be acceptable in real life hospitality, and it starts to get tedious. The paid boosters are still bit of a ripoff. Why not an upgrade to a frequent supply chainsuppliers, unless something like that is in later levels?

if you wanna get anywhere you need to watch ads more than playing the game. Food take too much energy and at the same time you have no space: you need a tonnes of machines to get the ingrediences and tonnes of machines to cook etc which leaves very little room for the ingredients themselves. You are forced to sometimes having to sell stuff you know you need later. I really liked the concept of the game but gave up and are now uninstalling. Pity

When I download a game from an ad, itd better be what the ad told me it would be. This one is not. Its an energy game, and you have to use energy constantly just to play. I didnt give it a chance to show me what happens when I run out of energy, because the answer is obviousif I want to play more, I need to use real money. Im not gonna keep playing if the game isnt immediately as advertised. Can developers please stop doing stuff like this?

I really wanted to give this game five stars  no intrusive ads, fun gameplay, cute art. However, when looking closer at the art, it appears that either the devs did not care to hire human artists, or they arent paying their artist(s) enough to care about making sure all the shadows line up, etc. This is unacceptable to me, hence the low rating. I say NO to AI, and pay your dang artists! Sheesh

This is a very high quality and good merge game, but there are some issues. The game itself is amazing, but its one of those games that require you to leave and come back over and over, or watch tons of ads. Second, I dont know if its just my electronic, but if you do too much while an ad is going it will glitch and send you to the starting screen and you wont get whatever you were watching an ad for. Maybe this is just me though.. overall, besides those mishaps, its a good game.

However, I noticed that they didnt have to spend diamonds to unlock the freezer, on the other hand I had to use diamonds to unlock every single cube and finally made it 40.

Previously, I had free ads everyday where I was able to earn some extra energy and gems. But after purchasing one pack during an event, the next day, all the ads were gone and I was not able to get any free ads to get free energy and gems. They only try to make you purchase more packs. Moral of the story: dont ever purchase any of the packs or you will lose your rights to free ads to earn extra chest, gems and energy. Taking 1 star away because of this issue.

This game seems to deliberately set up impossible situations. There are many random changes that negatively impact the ability to play. Edit At this point in playing, each set of orders are filled until the point of needing ingredients from the Pop up Book. It requires a long time to renew and gives fewer pieces. The process is so long, required resources are soon depleted and progress is at a standstill being unable to earn coins. Coins needed in order to move forward to the next order.

Rewards for finishing quests dont match the resources needed to complete. Mochas event offered me 20 energy for spending 200300. Coins and Gems may be the currency but energy is the most valuable. In the battle royale event, I spent over 300 energy but got 50 back. Rewards shouldnt be worth less than cost to complete. I dont do any quests that require energy bc I know I wont get good rewards after I finish. The energy generation cap is also too low at high levels, 100 is not enough.

Requires a ridiculous amount of energy to fill orders making it impossible to complete events and days to complete some orders, without spending cash.

Used to love it but since the last update, you can no longer double your daily prize and you can no longer watch a video for a free energy chest in the shop. I. fact all of the watchforfree things have gone. This makes it impossible to play, especially if you are midhigh level and the recipes are asking for things that would take 400 energy to make. I spent a little money on this but no more and at this rate I will probably uninstall it because it is going to get too tedious and boring.

Im uninstalling the game, Im at level 11 and one order has a pear. With 200 energy used, Im nowhere close to pear.

I actually enjoy playing this! Ive played it for couple weeks now and only splurged once on buying extra time. Usually play thru my time and then take a break, which is good otherwise Id just keep playing. Does keep your mind going remembering how to get certain ingredients and what you need for certain dishes, you can always look on info icon to remember too. I started playing to gain points with another app and done well reaching the goals, its taking a little time but doable.

Great merge game . completely hooked , would give 5 stars but dropped one , because now i have to uninstall it . I have reached level 19 . And unfortunately as far as i am going . The orders are more complex , taking up more energy , and its costing me too much money . Unfortunately on low income , i am unable to afford to play it . if you dont pay to top up . you have to wait for 1 energy ever so often . Big downside . So you go and play something else that isnt as good as you are hooked .

very worst game. For 1 energy it takes 2 minutes very over. In petal plate party event in last plate I didnt get hammers. hammer will come when we use energies and complete the orders . I used more than 700 energies and i complete more than 15 orders but even 1 hammer didnt came. And when we reach the max level of generators you have to give tools for another generator but youll give the same generator tools again and again. And to complete the album they never give new cards for the album.

I absolutely love this game but its been increasingly getting frustrating. Ive been playing for over a year, daily, and really enjoying it but recently the app keeps crashing moments after the loading screen finishes. The app also crashes when I sometimes double, with an ad, the reward and when I go back in it doesnt give me my reward after I watched the whole ad. Other than the crashes I really enjoy the game and plan on playing it as long as I can open it.

i really loved this game. its add free... i mean watching adds is optional. when u need some item or essential things u can watch add and get it. otherwise app never plays add by itself. not so difficult, can be win and go to next level. unlike other apps, u can clear the levels by just playing. no need to rely on watching adds all the time. i could give 10 stars. hehe

Ive been playing for about 2 months now and loving it. Ive been watching every ad to get more energy and keep progressing; I just enjoy the core gameplay loop. I decided to finally support them with the new Christmas pass and immediately lost all access to ads. Not no ads available, there just arent ad options where there used to be, like the 99 pass. Seems to be a pattern from other users experience. Now I regret buying the pass and losing access to a huge boost of daily progression.

I loved this game when I first started playing, but now, whenever I try to play it, it just freezes and crashes, and its started to get annoying. I just wanna play without it sending me back to the home screen every 5 seconds, Ive gotten to level 60, and I dont want to have to delete it and lose all my progress, but if it keeps not working, I might delete it for good.

I am so happy to see the cooking fever feature is back! I hope it stays as a permanent boost in the game. Merge Cooking is my favorite mobile game. It is addictive because its so relaxing and making the recipes is a fun challenge. I enjoy the mini games as well. The only thing I would change is to offer more ways to acquire free energy!

Fab game, would recommend to anyone! Ive been playing it for several years and Im never bored, regular updates keep it fresh. Plus absolutely 5 Customer Support! When I lost all my progress, and despite trying several times, couldnt restore I reached out, (although I didnt hold much hope) within 24hrs, and at the weekend, its all been restored. Im so grateful  I have never reviewed a game before, but this totally deserves it

Love it, despite the lack of energy sources but through watching ads. Ads wouldve been fine, except in my current location some ads are clearly scammers advertising fake investment content that takes you via the link to a page, open in browser, no google play. I get it, you are just working with ad providers and not responsible for the content. However, Im not getting this type of ads in any other game. So please pay attention if you care.

Game play is equal to that as advertises vs other games. but there no customer support so if your having trouble in the mini games there no one to ask whats wrong? as for adds there is pop ups when you load as to what purchase items. but no add vids to help with energy or gems.

I really enjoyed playing this game and would happily watch tons of ads just to get more energy and rewards. Recently the game now crashes very often after displaying ads and some of the ads are scammy because it forces the play store app to open even when i dont touch anything. I updated the latest version of the game and still no improvement. very disappointing.

Ive played off and on for a couple years. It was great for just passing time, challenging enough to keep it interesting and give you that little dopamine hit when you complete an itemround. You could play wout actually purchasing things with real money, though it would take you time. Today, all the little bumps you could previously use to get extra energy or items have either completely disappeared or been changed and it has severely impacted the game play. Guess Im done with this game now.

Im not a huge fan of this game. I like merge games and find completely challenges fun, but the complexity of the generators and then cooking ingredients in this game gets to be a bit much to keep track of. The bored is also too small to work on a bunch of orders at once and if you end up with extra ingredients after a order is completed you end up needing to get rid of them to free space up instead of saving till later. Generators take too long to cool down too.

this game would be great fun if you got a chance to figure out anything on your own. You dont have a chance before that stupid white glove comes out and shows you what to do. And when it does let you, there are no instructions for what you are supposed to do then. it needs more instructions and less interference

Game was fun at first but as others stated once you get to a certain point ot takes too long for energy to regenerate and the generators to run. Another HUGE issue is that you cannot delete previous generators and recipe books that you no longer use so you are forced to keep them in your inventory despite the fact you never need them again.

When I started playing this game, I was able to watch ads for extra energy. Now I can only do that about times per day which limits playing time. This has always been my favorite game but since energy is so limited, its taking the fun out of it. Today, I had played the game for awhile and after turning it off, I came back to check if my orders were complete and half of the game would not load. I uninstalled and cleared my cache, but still no luck. So sad.

Ive enjoyed this game for a while but suddenly all of the items that create dishes like the steamer, oven and those things cant be moved at all which means I cant merge them or store them. Obviously this is affecting my experience in the game as a thing needed in an order is a merge of the roast duck oven and because I cant move or merge them Im now stuck. Hope this gets fixed.

Game sucks, you can spend two days getting the food you need, then you cook it and and dont get the cooked food you needed, its suddenly something else, even though it was highlighted as the right food item, you put in the correct appliance, abd it started cooking it, shows on the order thst the order is cooking, little circle going around...then you get something else. Gnerators take forever to recharge, then work sometimes for only seconds before needing to be recharged for several more hours

this game is fun but getting stuck by wildly long cool down times for equipment is killing the game for me personally. I have plenty of energy but nothing I can use it on without using up the gems insanely fast just to be able to play. I used a 5 minute cool down reducer on a level 7 peice and it barely made a dent in the timer. please reduce the cool downs. And some of the packages are just too high priced for what the game is. It could be awesome.

I was enjoying the game. I didnt mind watching all the ads to get all the perks actually thought it was great compared to other games. however when I decided to make one small purchase you take away all the rewards that were coming from the ads. so now it makes the game enjoyable for a less amount of time. I have uninstalled it and dont plan to play again. and let me be clear i made a purchase that was offered to give me more energy because I was very close to reaching an order.

This is highly disturbing. I have been playing and enjoying the game for a very long time now. Yesterday I made my very first purchase, the 4.99 golden pass. Almost immediately afterward, I started noticing changes.. less videos available, less perks, changes in the store, less items from generators.. How can you so blatantly change the rules after someone makes a purchase simply because you hope they will spend more money rather than just being grateful that they did? Sickening and despicable.

Been loving this game, but its changed. I can usually watch ads every hour to get more energy, and some item bubbles would have the ad option to receive the item.

It could be a fun game, but there are two irritating things that almost make it not worth playing. One is that it wastes my energy when I am down to the last order. Its nice that I can watch ads to get more free energy, but most of the ads are a minute long, and the energy gets wasted quickly again. Second, it throws stupid bubbles on the board that you can only wait a minute to go away or use gems. Its annoying to wait a full minute to play again.

I love the concept, its a great variation on this type of game. The game play is too slow, you either have plenty of energy  generators are down; or generators are full  youre out of energy. Also, they give you little bits of equipment which fill up your board  storage  dont give you enough room for game play which becomes frustrating. Its unfortunate, it would be a great game if they didnt make it so slow  frustrating... expensive, the prices arent worth the short play time.

I loved this game before they started adding more and more popups trying to get you to buy things and completely took away the ability to watch ads in exchange for in game items. That feels like a WILD financial decision, because most people arent going to magically start spending money on the game just because they took away that function. People are just going to play the game LESS (like me) or completely delete it and download another merging game with less popups pushing purchases etc.

Game is great, support for game is NOT. Been playing for years, Ive spent money in the game, got a new phone  downloaded the game again. Now I have no option for ads to get free items or energy at all. I emailed support from within the game, it opened Gmail. Explained no ads issue, briefly mentioning my prior account that didnt sync. I got a generic FAQ type reply on how to sync my game, no mention of the ads not even being there,  told to email from in the game for support?? Im over it.

Due to the specifics of the ad platforms operations, I have not completed a single challenge since September. The developers are absolutely aware of the issues with energy in the game. The Facebook group talks about them daily. Players shouldnt have to beg for the ability to play, and I dont love the game enough to spend a bunch of money just to make gameplay as good as it was 6 months ago. I spend more time on other games lately keeping an eye out for ads that never come.

I loved the game for the simplicity. When I first started, you could get lots of ads for free energy, daily store items, and the prize trail with the dog, also to speed up timers. Just dont spend any real money! As soon as you do, the game or algorithm or whatev gets greedy. No more free ads for items, bubble items, or dog path. Im lucky I get ads for energy at all but thats it. Every bubble item now costs gems and the dog path is real money only, and no more speed timers. i may quit now.

A great game. coming here bcs the ads. but a great one to play. the little downside is the complex of the order but the payment is little for one order. i guess the poin for what we get is based on after yo replay it over and over again. But I thought that after the generator n equipment get leveled up, more of the fooddrink is become more. but no. like the peanut, ice cube, egg. theres no chicken wing etc. so is not really worth it to lvl up the generator

I cant give 5 stars to the game after updating. Some orders require much energy to complete but somehow the supporting ads have disappeared, and its really frustrating.

I saw an ad, mixing the theme of cooking games and merge games. I thought this would be different from the rest. Its not. The gameplay is the same as other Merge games. The complicated merging that becomes tiring after a while and other things. I can see myself enjoying this game in only one or two sessions before getting tired of it. Im really disappointed that the ad wasnt truthful to the gameplay. Atleast the ad showed a unique and intriguing game that I havent seen before.

This Game is fun but also addictive if you enjoy cooking and serving. But it will rob you of money which is why I gave it a 1 star. To advance in the game you have to spend a lot of money. And when you do spend money they make the game more challenging. And they have advertisements every time you run out of something or touch something. For this reason I do not recommend this merge game. There are other merge cooking games available in the play store that dont require you spending so much.

I dont know whats been going on of late, but for every 1 ad, 2 to ads will crash the game and make it restart. Been happening for abt 2 weeks now. They also need to Crack down on the type of ads they are promoting. Almost all ads have the fake X button making you click on them to force you to that ads website or Google play store. Ive even had ads take me straight to Google Play Store without me touching the screen at all. Thinking of reporting them and this game as Malware.

I turned in my duplicate cards on multiple occasions and never got that extra card?! How is that possible? It has to be rigged!! I wasted sooo much money!! I emailed them with attachments for proof and got this response even after the below response to my review!! Sorry for the inconvenience caused to you. Your feedback has been sent...

Was enjoyable till they started reducing the energy received for each milestone and then stopped the energy offer. Mind you, that was expensive but at least it allowed me to play. Now its barely playable without spending a tonne of cash. Probably going to uninstall it now. It only seems to want to take our money, and dont care if we can play or not. Just be aware that despite how good it is, in the end, its a scam to take our money. Lost my progress and everything somehow. I was at 155.

was a great game, but with this lastest update, it took away all ad options and made it to where you cant get any more extra energy unless you spend money. whats the point of a free game if you want to get anywhere within even a week you have to make purchases? every update you guys take a perk away, and Ive spent my fair share of money on this app, but now thats all I can do. bring back the ads to get energy and such. you guys just look like money hungry jerks right now.

The game is really fun and addictive. Unfortunately, its designed for you to spend loads of money. You either pay up or wait hours for energy to generate. You play for a few minutes, and youll need to wait again for energy to regenerate. Its extremely frustrating.

This new update has taken away all of the options to watch ads for more energy, diamonds, etc. Ive seen them comment on here and say its because the ads are random and thats not true at all. Ive played this game everyday for almost 2 years and those ads have been available every single day until a certain point and then you have to wait for them to reset. I get about 5 minutes of play time at a time now, where before I could play for almost an hour. PLEASE FIX THIS!!!

After coming across multiple suspicious bugs I decided to read the reviews. Ive noticed that you people dont care about anything your reviewers have to say unless sb is about to delete the game. Meanwhile, every time I try to play I have to watch ads most of the time, which 1. Cause the game to crash and EVEN disconnects me from my wifi and 2. Often the ads take me to Google play without even touching my phone. Its not normal for a GAME to have such control over my device. DELETE.

Im really annoyed at the moment with the popup book stuff. It takes days and days to merge the items that you need. Ive played this game for years and spent hundreds.

I really enjoyed playing Merge Cooking, but lately it has been having plenty of issues. The biggest one is often after an ad, the game reloads. I have just finished a session where it reloaded 3 times in 45 minutes. When it first started happening, I preserved thinking it could have been a random glitch, but it has only increased as time has gone on. Responding to reply:How can I answer your question? Cannot do screenshot when I dont know when it will boot me off. Play it and see for yourself

I love this game and have been playing it daily for a long time, and have gotten quite far. I had it backed up on Google play. I upgraded to a new phone yesterday and my other games transferred and saved my progress. This one did not save, and I had automatically saved before and it worked. Now I cant get to my progress. I reached out to the developer on email and no answer yet. Edit: i did do that and it didnt save. I cant screenshot the id because the phone was factory reset.

Overall I like this game. My only critique is that when my restaurants go from theme to theme I have a bunch of obsolete generators left over. The game will not let me delete because they are on max level. This is very annoying because it takes up an abundance of space in my storage. Not being able to delete maxedout objects causes me to have to delete things I need or use more of my hardearned gems to get more storage space when I could be using them elsewhere.

Minimal AI use except the flip cards, all items and popups and load screens are designed carefully. Their assets look so well made that other merge games steal them to run their ads. They even have a mascot girl who changes her clothes every season and holidays which is a nice touch. I love cooking feature  rare gameplay thats hard to find in other merge games. Ads are watchbychoice, and most last only 30s. 1010. Alright now that Ive fulfilled my duty, gem cat pls be back?

Writing a new review after deleting the game last year and reinstalling this year. Cant say anything has changed. High costs for very little benefit. Spending 15 would get you maybe 2 more minutes of active gaming. Theres like six events going on at once and you cant pass the first tiers without paying to complete them. I use the app for maybe a minute at a time before closing it to play something else just because theres nothing to do unless you pay for gems. Still generally ad free tho.

Its like the tutorial all the time. It doesnt let you make your own decisions... it constantly tells you what to merge and who to give the food to. How boring. Theres this little pointed finger that tells you what button to press... I just want to play. I dont need someone telling me when or what I should merge!

Im now on level 142. I think this one is better than most merge games we have around. The issue is that I have been experiencing problems for the last few months. I found myself writing emails to them every few weeks. For example. The game used to give 5 ads per hours which gives 25 energy each. Now I have 5 ads PER DAY. Its a huge setback, and it happened right after I spent 20 on the game. I told myself Id quit this game so many times already. Overall, I do not recommend (anymore).

Im not impressed with the newest update of this game. I have been playing this game for nearly two years now and have spent quite a bit of money on it but when I opened the game today I see that all of the perks you get for free while watching adds have been taken away. So there is nothing free left. Everything has do be paid with by diamonds. I would not have complained if I never made any purchases but it is just getting too expensive to keep playing.

the recent updates have been making me not play this game anymore. Using gems prior has always had a similar concept of cash back was removed, and now daily deals that were previously free to claim now require gems to purchase. Although Ive liked the recent additions of different challenges, it seems the game is going a different route of why Ive loved playing it in my free time for so long. Would be dropping this game for now and see the next update.

The event rewards are very little, even though it takes a lot of effort, energy, and many merged items to complete them. The rewards feel too cheap compared to what we have to spend. Higherlevel generators dont feel any different from lowerlevel onesthey should produce more highlevel items. On top of that, the energy recharge takes too long. Its getting boring.

update. they no longer give you ads to watch to get extra credits and the path has gone paying only to get. At the point of uninstalling If you can ignore the repeated problems of watching ads and not getting rewards and the fact that you can use over 200 energy to get to certain items and then have to wait 2 hours for them to cook. Its not a bad way to pass your time. I installed this to play with my son and with the problems he says no thanks...

this game is great, but the energy gets depleted way too quickly with no permanent upgrades on how much can be held. especially when it starts using 4 energy for every item, you get maybe 5 minutes of game play every two hours. then the events that require more orders than can be held at one time while needing to empty your energy three times for a single order. Im getting close to a point its not worth playing, all because the minimal energy.

This was put back to the way it was before, so changing my rating. I really do like this game because you get to pick when you watch ads. The most recent update was awful. The daily deals all cost diamonds instead of ads now, and you cant watch ads to get the 125 extra energy anymore. Plus, the level of items you can watch an ad to receive has gone down. This was my favorite game, and I may not even play anymore because I am being priced out.

The little tutorial hand tapping on everything gets annoying quickly and doesnt seem to go away no matter what level and you can only tap on what it tells you to tap. Six cherries on the screen and you can only use the cherries the game chooses and you cant continue to build up money or do a bunch of orders. You can only tap the exact item the game says too. Neverending tutorial. Seems like the game would of been fun otherwise.

This is a fun game to play but the only real problem is how many pop ups you are greeted with when you open the app. Everytime I open the game I get pop ups for deals (that are always the same) and different challenges to do. It would be so much better if they didnt pop up constantly but instead gave little notification bubbles on the little side icons. Other than that this is a great game.

Inventory Items go missing. You will spend a LOT of time  energy in the game to get higher items. Sometimes for MULTIPLE ORDERS with the SAME INGREDIENTS. You have to wait for the energy to build up just to discover those items you worked so hard for, have gone missing. Not misplaced. As if you never wasted 200energy for one item. Literally time  energy wasted. Havent heard anything from support. I doubt I will. Dont waste your time.

like, the game has potential and is fun...but the fun wears out real quick when it takes you all day, and i mean ALL day, to merge one single item. It takes all your energy multiple times, plus the ridiculously long wait time for the generators to recharge. then, even if you consider buying more energy or diamonds, they are outrageously priced. you could pay 5 and only get 50 energy and like 100 diamonds. its crazy.

After playing several merging games of the identical format, Im very disappointed this game is not player friendly. There are no ads to regain energy or speed up cool down time from dispensing tools and if you use gems to speed up the process it only gives half the amount if you would have just waited. The only reason its not 1 star is because Im waiting to see if the update fixes these issues. I wouldnt recommend this to anyone.

DO NOT PLAY. This game is an absolute money sink. They cycle through the same events with only slight changes and once they get their hooks in then you keep spending money just to play for only like ten minutes more. Hundreds of dollars wasted on this game. I Joined because of a fetch rewards event but it was NOT worth it. Im scared to know how much I spent. Im usually extremely good at avoiding purchases on free to play games microtransactions, but the sunk cost fallacy got me big time.

Game still shuts off music when you open it, or watch an ad and return to the game. Latest update changed the supercharge so you have to toggle through 1x, 2x and 4x. I actually liked this game compared to others because I could easily choose which one I wanted without toggling through them all.

the game is very addicting and I love it but I see no reason why you stopped giving 45 energy after an ad or when you get to to some certain number of coins now we get only 20 energy even if youve gotten coins closed to 500 that is supposed to earn more energy... please do something its frustrating Ive given you 5 star now please can I now watch adds to get energy??? I am so addicted I had to download on my other phone just to play this game and still I cant watch adds to get energy???

Oooh! A chance at better items if I spend 4 energy and you keep giving me level one items! How cool! Let me guess, youre going to say well you needed those items. Then explain actively not getting what I need on a regular basis and constantly giving what I dont need. I know what I need, Ill change my energy multiplier accordingly. Also, the ads and the popup windows have gotten out of hand. Perhaps Ill just hit uninstall......

Great game. Only downside is burning through energy fast and filling up the board and having to delete stuff you need for the next level. Waiting for generators and energy sucks unless you pay. But compared to some games, it has pretty good deals.

I really enjoyed playing this game for a long time, but the further you get in levels the more ridiculous it gets. they have equipment that automatically spawns and if your waiting for a max level item, your waiting weeks! if you want to get through it fast you have to spend hundreds of dollars. it just takes all the fun out of the game and makes you not want to play anymore.

i played this game for over a year now but the newest update made it so that i am not allowed to watch ads for anything in the whole game, and i relied heavily on watching ads for energy while i watch a tv show or play a game on my laptop, so this significantly reduces my enjoymdnt of the game. seems like other people are slso having issues recently so hopefully it will resolve but i am already considering uninstalling.

I thoroughly enjoyed playing this game until the update that took the ads away. I had no issues watching an ad to get back into the game. Now, it seems impossible to play.

suggestion  kindly add shredder to the merged item to de merge it. in order to get the item before it got merged so that if we mistakenly added item we dont have to push for long to get the desired item again and also it will save the space for other item to get merged.

I honestly cant recommend this one. Its not exactly bad, but its not good either. Its pretty much like every other merge games, except this one doesnt have a story to hook you in. Everything costs gems and energy. You can often watch an ad to skip the waiting time. But it feels like youre watching an ad to get 10 extra uses, then it dries out, you watch another ad and get 8 uses. (exaggerated, but you get what I mean)

Its a good game but once you get past Level 10ish it takes a lot longer to complete the tasks and you end up having to wait for the lives to refill, unless you want to pay for more lives, which I presume is what the developers want. Ill probably stop playing now as I can only play for a minute or two at a time and then have to wait a couple of hours for more lives. Not worth it anymore.

I enjoyed this game and played daily without spending a lot of money at all. It was fun and satisfying. Daily opportunities and the ability to double by watching ads made me willing to play and spend a couple bucks every now and then. I was on vacation and spent more than usual, and now all my options to watch ads and double freebies are gone and Im wildly annoyed. As soon as I spent money it was like everything switched to try to force me too, so I wont be playing anymore.

Everything takes too long, there is no ad watch for speed up, only in app purchases, that are extremely expensive comparatively to other games of this genre. The generators run out of use after maybe 10 taps and then you have to wait indefinitely. Theres no timer to see if you have time to do something quick or take a while. It doesnt help with your strategy. The only options are purchase with gems, typically a large sum of them. This game is boring. Find something else.

its a great game but energy finishes before orders finish and your prices of purchases for refurbishing goes up and the order of food is not enough to cover cost of repairs my suggestion is that you allow user to watch ads to replenish energy so gamers could finish orders and repairs and more offer of free energy and rubies and generator does not have enough goods and shuts down before you could finish orders

Nothing like the ads. I just want to merge cookingfood items... Is that too much to ask?! In the ads, Im merging similar items that are already there until the board gets empty. This game is more like making a generator in order to merge. Why is the ad and the game different, and why do I need a storyline? And, of course, you got to wait if you want to generate items... Its so unfortunate.

I love the game, but the energy cap is so low, it takes so long to get back to max, less than 1min to finish,  its just wicked that there arent ads we can watch to get energy. Also, the things are too expensive for so little rewards. I dont like that each time energy is purchased, the next purchase is double the previous. Also, I dont like that playing the cake merge has no purpose. It would make more sense if we could earn energy just by playing the cake merge or at least by watching ads.

This game is one of the best merge games Ive played, but with all the generator and appliance pieces waiting to be merged, theres never enough space. Whenif the storage issue is fixed (possibly by allowing pieces to be stored in a separate vault, like other games do with unnecessary generators or tools), Id gladly increase my rating. Until then, its just not fun anymore.

Great game! The only merge game I know that has devices(like the grill and juicer) to actually make food out of the merged items. Orders are fun, not too hard, at least till my level. I like how theres so many different kinds of events and that they have actually different mechanics, not just merge. A lot happens at once, so that stresses me out and a lot of the times I have to ignore them. The number of popup ads gets annoying and sometimes overwhelming. Lot of fun overall, though.

Previously rated 2 stars, I had a problem with ads not working correctly and was angry, but they fixed it because I havent seen the ad that messed up the game again. I really like this game, one of the only ones Ill spend a little money on! I love that its being updated with events and QOL updates and not left to rot. I really love that there are different options to get more energy! which is why I was so upset about the ads not working correctly because I couldnt get the energy.

Lots of non working ads and no way to video them for publisher. Only ONE BBQ to do a lot of cooking so it slows the game process. At level 141 it is by far worse. They need the pots and BBQs added!!!! LOTS OF PEOPLE COMPLAINING ABOUT THE BBQ and non working ads to get your free items. You can press on the item to bring up an ad a hundred times and nothing. Yes I have counted.

theres a glitch that removed a rare item of mine. Im 100 sure its not accidental as they claim i deleted it when i reached out to customer care. this item gives u a warning before delete and after delete u hv the option to undo.. why would i ignore all those options? theyve refused to return the item even when i explained everything and the sad part is it happened again after.

I love this game! I started playing it in my fetch app so I could get rewards. well.... the game hasnt given me points for it. I emailed fetch and they manually put them in there this time, but said they wont next time. I dont really want to delete this game, but if I dont get points for completely this level, I will have no choice.

Was Fun... Ads are gone and the daily awards cost money or diamonds and since the daily awards arent being granted, it cost money. I was one to occasionally make purchases, but I wont make anymore because its buggy. Some people have features others dont. Its a cool game and looks great, but it gets messy and now its unplayable.

Cant get into the game at all. It says to check my internet connection but thats working perfectly and every other game and app are working as normal. I really enjoy this game, after Mistplay recommended it to me, and Ive been playing ever since. I just want to be able to play it again  Edit: Lower star rating because Ive already stated that my internet is working perfectly and that its only this app that isnt working, so its condescending to be told to check the stability

Glitches and Crashes. Im level 135. So you can tell Ive been playing daily for well over a year. The game within the last couple months crashes if you watch an ad.

I honestly cant believe im STILL playing this game. I get bored of apps really quickly, but this one still has me hooked! Dont give up when it starts getting hard, you eventually unlock using x2 (and then x4) energies for each click. It makes it take less time to get the items you need and you dont need to use speed ups as often, though it drains your energy quicker.

I previously gave this game a fivestar rating, but I was quite disappointed to find that the new update has removed the rewarded ads. This game used to be very rewarding, allowing players to watch ads and earn ingame energy, but that feature is no longer available. Therefore, Ive unfortunately had to uninstall it. I even used to make inapp purchases. Its a shame......

The ad is NOT what game looks like at all. The story of being dumped has nothing to do with the game play either. Other than earning money to make new restaurants, thays really what the game is about. The amount of purchase this  that ad REALLYdisrupts the game play. The pop up in the middle of it. It takes 10 clucks at the beginning of just ads to start game playing.

I used to love this app, but someone is getting stingy with the app rewards. They keep getting smaller or having to do more for just something small. 1 minute ads now. Energy rewards for finishing all the customer orders was cut in half. Its a game thats going down hill. Edit: After the continued downhill of this game, Im done.

I used to LOVE playing this game because even though at some point it would run out, they ALWAYS gave you plenty of whatever you needed in the game to be able to play for awhile. Its why Ive been playing it for over 8 years. But now it really seems like the only way to play this game is if youre willing to spend money and while I understand the creators have bills, SO DO WE. Not everyone can afford to spend money on a GAME! Really disappointment. Was my favorite game

game is fun but once you get to a certain level its hard, it takes so much energy to create one item. I really hate that if you get too close to the same item it automatically merges them and then they charge ridiculous amounts of gems to undo, gems cost way too much money to keep on hand. I have a sensitive phone and when I dropped it earlier somehow 1 of the items got hit and when I tried to undo it it costed 90 gems which is expensive plus no way to contact support

Ive played merge games before and they are pretty much the same. This is no different except you cant turn off the tutorial finger pointer. Its annoying when you just want to play but cant because that pointing finger keeps popping up and telling you to make a move you dont want to do. I looked to deactivate the feature, but its not an option, so I gave the game my finger and uninstalled it.

Today you get none of that! Other people have said the same and support just say it depends what ads are available. This doesnt change the fact you want gems for daily deals now!

Developer, not true, the option is no longer there and several people have commented this would have been 5 stars but...It takes forever to recharge the generators and when you pay with gems it doesnt do a full recharge. I also used to be able to watch videos for free bonuses and I just noticed today that option was taken away, when a bubble appears with an extra item I could also watch a movie to get it and now I cant. I wont support a game like that and will delete unless this is put back.

I am at level 186 so Ive been playing for a couple of years now. I enjoyed the game immensely and have spent quite a bit of money on it. But over the last 3 months and last couple updates, there has been noticeable changes .... Many perks have been taken away, the generators have to recharge more quickly than before, for many orders it takes a couple of days to complete unless you spend money. I will not support a developer who blatantly forces users into spending money to continue playing!

one of the worst game ever. it takes forever to make a dish and there is no free generator to make it worth visiting the game except waiting for 3 hours for the energy to fill up. and as we progress, it takes 1800 coins to pass even one task (in which we have to complete 3 to 4 different sets to collect the coins).

Houses regenerate the rare items WAY too SLOW! Game devs dont think this through because this is one of two games I spend real money on and EVERYtime I have to start over with these houses I regret spending a dime and going back to not purchasing! This does not make the game more difficult, it just makes it more frustrating and BORING! Its rediqulous that with every set of orders there has been a high level VERY rare item needed! Never thought Id say this but I might be done with this game!

Let me play the damn game, this annoying piece of work is always in tutorial mode. It doesnt even take a second after doing anything for a big hand to obscure your view telling you what to do. Every single move, every single time. Besides that, everything else is terrible. The intro scene ruins most of the motivation for playing the game. The merge mechanics require very frequent and long wait times. There is not a shred of originality in the game besides trying to milk microtransactions.

Basically the run of the mill Gardenscapes except now you have to merge items together to get a product that is being asked for by a virtual customer instead of block three of the same items to satisfy the challenge. The intrusive ad is what made me install the game, but it was misleading . I thought I was gonna get to prepare orders like in cooking game but it was more of this merging than any preparing food like a short order cook. Needless to say I uninstalled it after the first time.

removed almost all ads for extra energydaily items etc so now it is heavily pay to play if you want to get anywhere. Theyll tell you its due to signal (not a concern here) or available ads because of location etc. However, if every other game that exists is able to continue offering ads, it is not the ad service malfunctioning or running out of ads, but is instead a dev tactic to push people into buying things with real money based on some internal metric. ppl who spent real money maybe?

not only is this game not at all like its advertised, it also gets very hard and very pointless after less than three days of gameplay. if youre into merge games, this one has about two days of gameplay before the only thing you can do is fulfil customer orders that are SO high level it is just grinding and waiting over the course of days to have enough energy points to generate the numerous low level items required to reach an 8x doubling scale, thats over 500 low level items to reach 8

I Really like it My favorite (And only) Merging Game its Good in every Way BUT When you get to Level Three (The InCRABible Transformers Like Truck) the Offline Merging Game Just turns into a ONLINE GAME! If You fix this up I will not Stop Playing is Game (I would say 5Stars but because of this problem 4stars)

This game is addictive and the makers of it are also shady. Dont make purchases on this game! The game will cheat you out of purchases! The side games will end earlier than they are supposed to, cheating you out of rewards. You wont realize it, but the double cost for generators will turn on automatically, screwing you out of points. Im getting points from this game for another app, so Ill hold onto it a bit longer, but I dont recommend it.

A warning to anyone who wants to spend money on this game: they will screw you over. The moment you buy a pass or ticket, you can no longer earn with ads and support will ignore you. Dont waste your money. To reply: it is a well known occurance that anyone who buys something will lose ads. Its not that there are no ads available, its that you dont even have the button to try. Dont believe me? just check the merge Cooking reddit Sub to see how annoyed your customer base is getting.

Ive played for a VERY long time, but Im uninstalling today. The number of popup ads for premium packs alone is bad, but they also throw so many flashing symbols and exclamations at you its annoying and frankly overwhelming. One of those close 3 popups when you launch the app games. Ad rewards have gotten so lame it feels like a waste of time, too. Its all very predatory and so obnoxious its totally ruined the game. Super disappointed, especially for how many hours Ive put into it.

Because of the unhelpful and totally wrong reply I received I would give this app zero stars if possible. Yes I did earn those gems through playing the game, thats what I said and I could use them to speed up timers and such. Thats what gems are for and yes you can purchase more if you choose. This apps money grubbing events took what I already had and required me to pay cash to get back what I already had. Zero to do with in app purchases or discounts. Terrible player support !!

We play games to think, make decisions, and sharpen our minds. But this game only allows you to do what it tells you. It just shows an icon and tells you to drag it somewhere  thats it. I downloaded this hoping for a fun, interactive game, but all it does is give mindless instructions like an activity for a 3yearold child. Total waste of data. I strongly advise others not to download this. Very disappointed with this kind of product.

Its an alright game however I really hate the constant trying to force the player to spend money its really annoying. Example being, right when you open the game you get like 34 pop ups asking you to spend money on energy or gems with the lie that their 100 off. It makes the game really unbearable. Not to mention the events! Too many! And forces you to participate somehow before leaving you alone, I hate the food race! Not to mention the game crashing! It closes out randomly!

this game doesnt value the players time at all! i had to sit through two ads to get like 4 coins but the same two ads can also get you 25 more energy to keep playing. thats a very big difference in value since coins are far less valuable than energy to play. and then theres the issue of your merge board. it eventually gets so full of generators that you have no actual room to assemble more than one rare item at a time, making it more of a hassle to complete longer orders.

I like it but its impossible to play for very long without paying more and more. And the fact that the gems needed to get energy double each time throughout the day(10, 20, 40, 80, etc) is likely going to be the thing that eventually leads to me getting so annoyed I stop playing. If they left it at 10, Id play more often

I dont even have the option to view ads to speed things up. My partner does. Its very irritating, Id be 100 willing to watch them. If this was fixed, would be 5 stars.

Totally paytowin! They offer some advertisements in the beginning to help get some energy and items but in the highest levels these advertisements gone and the only way to get the energies is spending money, cause if youll wait for the energies restore, it take hours and hours, making impossible complete the orders. Is better not even start to play this game.

Its addictive but frustrating as hell that the energy takes so long to replenish and can only watch so many ads. Energy needs to be easier to get and quicker

Gamification in this game is too excessive. To the point they even sell ingame packages for the mini games. I know the developers need to make money but its too much.

Ever since the update, you cant watch videos to buy generator pieces in the shop. Not can you watch a video to get an extra chest on the Chefs Pass. I dont like that.

its a very addictive and relaxing game but i want an updat. Energy level must be gone from 100 to 300 because the products we made consume all the energy for only one order . consider it

the game was fun, but I uninstalled because I am very against eatingcooking lamb and seeing that imagery is not comforting for me, in general I dont like seeing raw meat so its just more of a me issue. but otherwise, a really fun game besides the AI SLOP

This game is fun, but its a bit scammy. Youll go broke playing it if you actually spend money to get diamonds for energy. The amount of energy and diamonds you have to use to actually get items to fulfill orders is ridiculous, and purchasing the diamonds to get energy is expensive.

DONT PLAY, ITS PAY TO PLAY!! the first 3 levels were great and after that everything went down hill from there. 1. you have to pay for the diamonds and dont last long. 2. the Prize pool games inside the game are horrible for players. plus they only give like 5 diamonds at most and expect you to pay 112 diamonds a orange. 3. I thought this was going to be fun. THIS GAME IS PAY TO PLAY. Dont recommend

Ive been playing for months and now at level 175. But recently the updated changes make the game so hard to play, no more ads to watch in the Road to treasure to refill energy and diamond, the one which gives you diamonds back when you use diamonds is also removed. Not interesting anymore when it really becomes a paytowin game

with the last update you removed ALL and I mean ALL ways of earning energyrewards by watching ads. how is it even fair? I used to spend a fair amount if money on your app but now I feel like Im being robbed and no way Im gonna spend another dime on it until you give us back the old rewards system.

the game is fun but do not spend any real money in the game. your diamonds will slowly just go away if the game is inactive for a while, and if you message them directly about it, they respond with there is no issue. but I have started keeping track and Ill go to sleep with 14 diamonds like I did last night and wake up and only have 5. Im about to delete this app just wanted to warn others first.

This would be a good game, it has lots of events and challenges, but the generators that create your items go on cool down after making maybe 10 things. Sometimes if you speed it up you get 4. I have 10 generators all on cool down and the only way to speed them up is to buy packs. Its miserable. After the first couple levels your board gets cluttered and its hard to finish orders unless you spend a lot of money. Which Im not willing to do.

Great merge game and graphics, but I hate that you cant choose anything you build. The game automatically builds your stuff without your input. Boring.

Great game (until the Luna event doesnt load and crash your game so you start all over again just to get the same problem) Not much from the support page, it makes out its a device problem not the game!

Ive loved this game for years but theyve slowly eliminated options to play ads to lessen cook times or get daily gifts. now you have to use gems (that you buy) to do any of that and its become a huge cash grab. the entire reason i stayed was because I was willing to watch ads for better gameplay and I was willing to pay money every now and then. but now I refuse to drop a dime and will most likely uninstall unless they change things back.

this wouldnt be awful if I could turn off the nagging hints. I dont see a way to and its really annoyingly distracting. once youve played one merge game, you really dont need hints.

Ive been playing for ages but the latest reward pass thing has stopped working and whenever I press it, it says downloading resources. Tried reinstalling several times to no avail. Its been happening for a week. Otherwise its fun to play I guess.

i rated it 5stars because its so relaxing and beautifully arranged.its very addictive i must say when you start playing you can never go back. but my problem is when your energy finishes, youll have to buy from the store.but if you dont have the money to purchase, youll have to wait till its recharged. its a thumbs up to the organisers of this game

it was better when i could watch ads for bonuses. since the ads have been taken out i no longer play this game. Response: no, i will not be rating this higher because you are only trying to make us spend more money. Im completely uninstalling after your response. You ruined a fantastic game for greed.

Im moving my rating up from 2 to 5 stars. This has been my goto merge game for a few years, but I didnt like the way the generators went back into cooldown immediately after one cooldown ended if you used it right away. Recently there have been a lot of features added that has made the game more playable (e.g. ads to pop bubbles, ads for energy, occasional unlimited generator use, etc.) Good work, devs. Keep doing what youre doing.

The game is good but the energy cap is so annoying. The developer should understand why they made this game. if you cap too much people have no option but to uninstall the game.

I love everything about this app !! but one of the things I love about it is that the food we make there is so realistic and most of the time exactly like the photos you can find on the internet. it feels like Im actually making those food, and I cant explain with words how relaxing it is !! I could play all day if I had unlimited energies ngl
