I like the games youve been giving me so far. Ive been winning quite well. Actually I didnt believe I would win, but Ive just won loads of money on that. Got more a Justin bin player. Ive won a legendary worth of world loads. Ive won absolutely millions. I wish it was for real.Id be a multimillion now.I dont know how many words Ive got to put down here but yeah, its a good game.Its quite funny actually, but I like the other one.The one with the train song. When it says all the board

Fun only at the beginning. After you lvl up enough, everything becomes impossible. You will NOT be able to compete in the events because they all require huge bets. (the race, no chances to lvl up 10 times without buying chips with real money, A LOT of money. The jackpot event, same thing, you need to hit huge wins that can only be made with huge bets) If you can afford to spend 1020 dollars a day, you will have fun, if not, all your chips will vanish in a matter of minutes. Greedy.

giving this a 2 star instead of 1 simply because before level 25 game was alot of fun. once level 25 hit wins became next to none hundreds of spins before any bonus witch only avenged about 510 times bet payouts. quests are bugged and dont work support non existent. I really had high hopes for this game at first but as others state once you progress some in game the true game comes out. Game has potential but devs need to stop the greed until then just your average  grab app.

First Slot Game Worth Playing! Ive been playing this game for a few weeks as of writing this review. Most slot games last a day or two, then youre out of money in game, so you either have to watch ads or buy coins. This one actually lets you win. The bad...if you dont want ads, you need to make a purchase. I paid 1 for a few coins, gems, and ad removal. That is all Ive spent. I noticed some games pay out better than others, and a big jackpot once a day on average. Definitely worth playing

I have to admit Ive had a lot of fun playing this game,even threw real money on it a couple of times.The games are great with the great art styles and many features throughout the games. Then you hit a stalemate sort of when you have played for a while. Youve advanced to level 1200 and go broke. You can say goodbye to trying to win jackpots when the minimum bid that I came across was 18B just to keep the Megas active. So it has been fun, but yeah, Im done and cant advance any further.

Game was really fun at the start but like most of these slots games you dont get good wins unless you purchase stuff, constantly it just balances your coins you get a good win it robs you and then you win again and your back at the same amount of coins you were at for it to do the same thing again. The only way to win big is bet higher as you need high bets to even unlock the major or grand jackpots which never hit anyways, you cant bet big because then your back to square one of being robbed.

I actually thought this was one of the last decent slots games. Wow, has my opinion now changed. The bison event is the biggest joke ever. Over a 100000 feathers used and was given a single free game. That didnt even become a big spin. Was never given anything but duplicate puzzle pieces. Wasted all my gems on nothing was never given a new puzzle piece in days. You give zero value for all the money you expect people to spend. You should be ashamed of the game you ruined.

I want a refund. Bought some things and immediately lost all the coins... Millions worth and only progressed 2 levels in the little garbage treasure hunt dont waste you time or money on this. You will loose all your coin betting what ya need to do progress then as soon as you lower your bet you win so you dont recoup what ya was lost. 20,000,000 spent won 80,000 you CANNOT WIN LIKE THAT!!!!

0 STARS  Absolutely will not tolerate advertisements RIGHT AFTER BIG WINS. I came here to play slots, NOT TO WATCH STUPID ADVERTISEMENTS. DELETING this game. Im sorry but just THINK about it, you people are MIXING the BIG WINS loving awesome emotions, WITH the HATING advertisements emotions. Its absolutely RUINING the PARTY. I just couldnt stand it any longer and quit it. In my specific case, buying advertisements out, isnt an available option. Still such beautiful Graphics!

This game was great for the first week or so, but now m, everytime I win big on any game an ad pops up. (didnt happen the first week of playing). Which I understand games like this are going to have a ridiculous amount of ads, but like 70 of the time an ad pops up after a big win, it redirects me to my google play store for the app the ad was for and it closes me out of the game. Pretty annoying that I have to reopen this game every 510 minutes while Im playing. Should try to patch this...

this is why i wait until a few weeks into playing to review. here is the honest review. first week is great. youll hit lots of wins and youll get hooked. slowly you will start to lose and might feel the need to purchase money to get back. it will work for another week, then its all down hill. slots do not win money, mini games sometimes do, and the micro transactions give false promises of high wins. (once out of the 100 times or so ive seen something higher than what I could purchase)

This app is a ripoff. I just noticed it often deducts way more than your bet from your balance, so you run out of coins and will need to purchase more. Earning free coins are minimal. When you bet higher or balance gets really high, algorithms change  suddenly you wont win anything and lose all coins so again they want you to buy more. This app should be shutdown for fraud just on the taking more coins than you bet. Ive watched it happen, but I cant figure out how to document proof.

once You start betting more than 10M it starts to drain You, I cannot even enjoy the game at that point, it should be fun, not like real casino, I had the app for few days but instead of feeling relaxed playing it I was feeling like I was playing with the casino, its only just bonuses that gives You the win, not the actual spins, but at that point game rarely even gives You bonuses, oh and also every single time, the jackpot is on Mini, not even minor or grand. The worst experience ever.

As soon as I hit level 500, my wins have been so meaningless. I went from 600 billion to less than 100bill in 3 days, betting less than 2bill per spin, and playing a bunch of different games. The only money I spent was the 99 cents to remove the additional intrusive ads that started out of nowhere. Other than that, I refuse to spend real money to win fake money. The algorithm needs to change asap

its fun  entertaining,  you dont have to worry about gettingbecoming bored, because its nearly impossible!...that said, I feelthink theres wayyy too much going on  once; its difficult to keep up  understanding whats everything going on  the same time... especially when it shifts back, forth, here, there, elsewhere,  between so often.! Slow it all down just a little bitits like, before or immediately upo grasping the concept of what the point is, it shifts,  again,  again, etc.

This is actually a cool game to play. So far so good. Great entertainment and loose and easy slots. All of this while Im racking up the cash. Just hope it tracks well .Update, after playing for 50 levels I go back to check my progress and then I see that the app wasnt even tracking me. I accepted the allow when it came up. Dang! Was really enjoying the game.

I have biometrics turned on for play store purchases... my kids play on my.phone and managed to make 4 separate 9.99 coin purchases WITHOUT my fingerprintpassword... I tried contacting the developer to point out the issuebug in their game and got told its not an ingame issue they cant do anything to help me... contacted google play and they tried refunding me 3 smaller amounts (that I actually authorized) which still doesnt resolve the ingame issue nor my full refund... hope this works!!!!

Fun interactive games that pays a ton in coins. New games that play different than other casino style games. Have not played in a while. This site unlike others , stays consistent and true. Got the bonus spins and on 1st of 6 spins won a good amount of coins. The 2nd was ok amount the 3rd was nothing and the 4th was a little bigger the 5th was a little bigger and the final spin I got 3 more spins with 2 being Massive Wins. Unlike other sites , this site DOES NOT fix the outcome of your spins.

This is the game you love to hate , been playing for years, started out with adds when you change games now after any good size win, sometimes the add tries to start so fast it kicks you out the game all together, its a shame this game could really be great, I won only one grand prize, all the side games you never win the jackpot, i dont buy money so that probably why.

This app takes too long to open even with a high speed internet connection it takes forever, and sometimes it doesnt open at all, it gets stuck on (Update checking within the app while trying to open) even when you are running the newer android version. As far as winning while playing is good no complains. The issue is opening the app. Once they solve that problem most likely i will rate this app higher. But on the mean time just TWO stars.

I gave this game a 5 star but after playing it for months I think it only worth one at the beginning they let you win now you have to bet more and all you do is lose they have quest and when you play them it like win 15 times but your winning percentage is 1 percent so you lose a lot I never hit a grand prize the whole time playing it so if you want people to spend money on your game you should make it worth it Im not going to lose to spend money one of worst games.

I have reached out so many times to these guys both thru the game and at a Gmail address NO RESPONSE. My whole family played this game and during Christmas our screens froze on the Jackpot Fiesta. It was a mini game that was in the Christmas Carnival. It is too big for our screen :( This happens with a couple of the games we just X out and start over and we are fine. With this though, everytime we try and start up the game, it goes directly to this screen. It is so disappointing!

starts off good but once you get to higher levels its hard to get a win and when you do you will lose everything if you keep spinning at the same level as it will just eat all your chips until you have nothing left. bots are your opponents in every comp, ads every time you get a big win more adds if you run out of chips and dont want to pay for more,leader boards are a list of bots, played for 2 months now and Im done, the only good thing I can say is the slots and mini games are good design

disgusting profiteering as usual from Betta Games. Starts off giving game bonus features frequently and purchases are small. Good fun as it should be. Give it about 3 weeks and a game bonus feature is like hens teeth and youre being asked to pay 10 for any decent purchase. THIS IS MEANT TO BE A FUN EXPERIENCE, BETTA GAMES! You must think people are playing for real money BUT WERE NOT! its meant to be fun where you enjoy feature games. Disgusting money grabbing

Reward scaling is very bad. Leveling up costs upwards of 30b for me and rewards 300m. Im betting 1b and all of the deals it wants me to buy are around 10b. If you want me to buy anything it needs to actually benefit me. So many rewards just stop being worth it after youve played for a day. Needs better rewards, and a way to stop showing pop ups for deals after youve seen them once.

I love how they come on here and say reach out to us... and when you do you get a generic reply that is cut and paste and then they stop talking to you... if I could give zero I would.. they still have not fixed the game. it cost two to three spins over the achievements to progress... achievement says spend 20 gold but u have to spend 50 to get it. if it benefits the player they make changes.. if it benefits them they wont. how this has a 4.7 rating is amazing. con artist

I have been playing this game for quite awhile and overall I enjoy it....I find most of the side games absolutely impossible to finish like the puzzles etc... you would have to play 247 and probably buy something just to finish the first level...I hate the animal feature. I appreciate the ways you can get extra coins without buying. Once I run out of money I will uninstall as there is nothing remarkable about this game. Very repetitive ads

THE BUY BOX WONT GIVE UP DAILY BONUS, HAS BUGS. THE BARS ABOVE SLOTS THAT COLLECT ICONS MOVES AT A GLACIAL PACE. LIKE ALL YOUR OTHER APPS, ITS A PAY TO PLAY. AFTER REACHING A CERTAIN LEVEL, PAYOUTS GO AWAY. PAYOUTS LOW ON SOME. RIGGED. CARD COLLECTING IS LAME AS NO ALBUM EVER GETS COMPLICATED AND YOU DOLE OUT THE SAME ONES CONSTANTLY.

Downloaded the app from an ad on a different game. The ad said if you dont hit a jackpot of 10 trillion coins in 10 spins just delete the app. Well Ive given it several hundred spins yet still no 10 trillion coins. I will however wait for a response from support before I delete the game. I wont be like some people that spend real money to win fake money. Guess Ill see what customer support has to say.

when you start out the game lets you win plenty. and if you need to purchase coins it is cheap and the value is great. but when you start getting more along in the game the value goes away and the wins become scarce. even side features become terrible and always seem to give you the bare minimum. soon youll need to spend a lot of money only for it to last you 30 mins at most before its gone. theyll reply to this saying to lower my bet etc... but then certain parts of the game are locked.

This game provides false advertising and attempts to cut your wins to make you purchase coins, recently played purchsed the dragons deal to try to win bigger coins, paid my 8.49, the bonus game spun up 96 so should have received around 20 trillion coins however only received a bit over 3 trillion, reported issues and after numerous messages and every sarcastic excuse under the sun, back and forth with yuki I am still no better off, very frustrating and disappointing false advertising

Used to get a 5 STAR rating. Not anymore! Im currently at Level 1672. Took a long, long time to get there. USED TO BE you had to work to get to the level of a game you were looking forward to playing. NOT ANYMORE! I had been playing Super Fox Heist for months. Suddenly moved it all the way down to Level 1760. FOUL!!! You CANT just up and move a game HUNDREDS of levels forward!!! Same with  Ghostly Sea Overlord. Not as bad, but theyve moved it TWICE when I was almost in reach. FOUL!

Used to be my favorite game that have a great graphics but unfortunately the time is to move on. The game winning chances turned like other slots game with a possibility of hitting a jackpot in real life is more real than this game. Not sure if its real or fake to see accounts winning prices with T and Q in this game. I reached level 1000 and the only way to make money is through the mini games they have but not the slots. I know my review wont make them change the winning statistic they have.

It was enjoyable at first. I see how they draw people in with so many big wins at the beginning, then it shuts down after some time. Its almost impossible to gain, even across multiple slots. Even the bonus rounds wont even add up the amount youre single bet. Apps like this keep me out of casinos for a reason.

I loved this game over the past year, excellent selection of games and altho I did expect and made coin purchases it didnt break the bank. With the forced update everything changed. First of all the ads to buy coins will just lock on your screen and when you try to close them another one replaces it over and over.

UPDATE: THIS is a cash grab, and YOU are their cash cow! UNINSTALLED THIS APP after 7 days of actual play. THIS iteration is designed to rope you in, give you a sense of awe at your ability to multiply your wins. Similar to a live casino, when you become a paying customer the Downward Spiral begins, leading you rapidly into the hellhole of financial destitution. USERS will see that if you dont buy any coin, your balance will reach zero REAL FAST. Youve been warned.

Start well as most free to play slots do but will eventually get tedious. Revisited for the welcome back missions. Various out of slot bonuses totalling approximately 30b coins completely vanished as every single slot regardless of stake just does not pay out. Worked out that the average payout is less than 5 of overall bet after level 200. So for every 1b coins played Id recieve 50m in return. Utterly pointless getting invested. As soon as ads start or you start seeing a decline delete it.

the game is OK. Here is the biggest issuered flag. This game will block the jackpots off if you bet below a certain threshold, the higher level you achieve the higher your bet has to be, totally normal on slot games, here in the red flag. I am at level 9,700 and my in game bonuses are the same they were at level 1. any other slot game your in game bonus get higher as you get higher. A 3b bonus when it takes 165b to even unlock jackpots is BS. Forces you to spend or not play. big big WARNING.

Hello all, I actually like this game. However, upon continual play of Dollar Express I noticed that random bonuses dont appear often, if not at all. Trains and money will stack ,but never pay out. The gold train doesnt stop in the 5th column to activate the bonus. no excitement. If youre lucky  get 4 of the all a board to trigger the bonus there is no change of winnings nor spins. It also glitches when reward notifications pop up. I bet over 60,000,000 and buy coins. Its not mathing to us.

Well from what I see from all slot games is identical. At first you win, win  win  it pulls you in. Once you always play  make more Billions  especially Trillions, now when you try to bet bigger, you win less  less. Say u have 6 Trillion, you have to bet 21 Billion minimum to activate Grand. If ur winning 2 Billion here or there ur still losing because the win doesnt even cover ur bet. Same thing when u hit a bonus round. One Billion, whooo, 10 Billion, still doesnt cover ur bet.

Update: i saw another advert for the game. Thought I would see if they stopped trying to rip people off. Nope. Same game play as all other bogus slot games. Play for the first 30 minutes win a ton. Constantly increase max bet or you dont qualify for jackpots. 30 min to an hour win about even with 1 big win to get you to 1b coins. After that lose it all while constantly getting ads thrown in your face. Avoid all slot machine games. They are all bogus.

Excellent game!!! Its very hard to find a slots game that is fun and not so boring with the same old slots that have nothing fun or point about it. This one has side games and quests you can do which makes it fun then!! Also more exciting and you win more on here than other slot games that make you broke very fast and make you have to buy to play. So far no bad comments but if it starts getting bad at winning then I may reconsider uninstalling because letting us win more keeps our attention!

This game is not designed to help you win it just wants you to spend actual money on fake money anytime you get a big win they just take it all back from you in the next and then take more you constantly lose money instead of making it which is why I barely play it anymore anytime I do I end up losing at least 3 trillion when I play youre lucky to break even with what you had when you started the game and when customer support is contacted they just tell you to play the game when its hot

Just lost 470 trillion at 2.7 trillion per spin on 3 primal souls...bonuses are rare and the blue expansion bonus just sits there and will not go off its been well over 400 spins since it went off. The only players who dont go broke are the big spenders which are the same people in the top 10 winners of every slot. This is not completely randon for fairness as the developer claims. This game is a waste of time unless you are gonna spend a ton of money. Big cash grab they got going here.

If you love to be frustrated, this is perfect! The games are great, but most every big win it crashes and you have to open, close popups, find your game, and hope you dont get another big win on the first spin  and start all over. I sent a ticket, never heard back. Great game other than that.

Everything was great until it wasnt. Once they decide they want you out, its impossible to win. They under pay you they take more than your bet, you cant get a free spin, and if you do get one, you wont win anything. if you dont spend money, a lot of money then you wont be winning for long. they will just make you miserable. I finally had to give up and uninstall them. I really loved this game, but its just not worth it anymore . they cheated me in so many ways its disgusting.

This game has too many glitches and shutdowns. When you get a large win, the ad freezes the game, then plays and then shuts the game down. This has happened three times today in the span of 20 minutes. It appears to be an ongoing problem. I understand the need for ads but make it less frustrating and more usable because with all the shutdowns and restarts, you cant play the game for too long. Im hoping it gets fixed.

Basic pay to play game. I hate when a slot game raises the bet to win ratio. The higher your level gets the more you need to bet to play the mini games or qualify for mini games. Example is when you need to bet 36 Billion credits to be qualified to play a Bingo Blitz game, with very little winnings.

I liked the commercial but dont believe what u hear, almost like false advertising. I would never purchase knowing I would never get a bonus . 40 billion to get 2 billion bonus. Ur not different from the other games. Still standing on my comment after another round. Play up, u get big bonus, but never another bonus til ur almost out or out. Tell me again why ur different? And why would someone play the quest when the return is sooo little? another disappointment. 625.

Horrible, just another cash grab slot game. Win big the first day you play then they take it all from you so they can sell you coins. I was up over 500M, betting 1M at a time after being up and the game bled me dry, they say its random but its hard not to question when the first day you play youre getting bonus games, big payout then its all gone, no more bonus games and and tiny payouts, but plenty of ads to buy more coins. Just know its fun for a day, unless you spend money then its fun.

This game is an example of Legal Theft. When you begin playing they offer decent real cash purchases and the longer you play it, the quicker the cost of coin, gem or features go up; for example, the piggy bank used to cost 10 (approximately), now costs 65.99 for relatively, the same amount of coin. When you complain to the developer they insult you and then block you from posting on their community group. WARNING DONT EVEN START WITH THIS GAME

This game used to be fun. You spend a lot of money because of the zeros. It was okay until I got cheated. I won and I was betting high. They said To bet higher. I am done. Beware of their cheating. They change the best and it lags and freezes a lot. They change the icons while you are spinning. They make excuses. I sent messages via email. They ignore you. When customer service dies answer they dont talk about the issues you are talking about. You cant get in touch with the developer.

Its one of the better ones that plays a lot more fairly. You dont mind spending a couple of bucks here and there. You dont lose it all in a matter of minutes and if you play smartly, and lower your bet a little, you can rebuild what youve lost. Most other slot games make that almost impossible to do.

If you advertise your game to uninstall if you dont win a jackpot of 10 trillion coins in 10 spins you should back it up. Upon downloading the game it immediately takes you to the purchase coins screen then hits you with an ad. Win ratio is alright but games are lack luster. Not worth the download and to many ads for a game that pushes purchases so much

This game is rigged. Ive spent over 100 with this company only to notice that many of the games are rigged. The straw that broke the camels back, is when during a jackpot feature, I was getting a variety of winning symbols until I was 1 symbol away from the bigger jackpots when suddenly only the smallest winning symbols came up for the rest of the game. I reached out to the devs and was told basically thats just my bad luck, however the odds of this being natural luck is astronomically low.

As others have mentioned, this starts off good, but then to complete certain quests for example, it will say bet a minimum of 15 million or even 30 million till you win a set amount. Theres a slight problem though, at that bet amount you are lucky to win anything, never mind something thats higher than your bet amount. Also be aware that after a few days theyll start showing you adverts. I dont mean adverts to watch for coins, I just mean they start inserting adverts at random intervals.

Edit: Deveoper missed the point in their reply, losing was not the issue, it was the infinite cycle of popups it caused. 200 spins without a single win, taking every coin you have and then continuously cycle through ten different popups to get you to buy a fraction of what it took back. If it did it once I wouldnt mind, but it will just spam them endlessly unless you can hit the reduce bet button before the next pops up. Way too desperate for money for something that gives nothing back.

FAKE 5 STAR REVIEWS!!!! Notice all the 5 star reviews have just a few words and are very generic. But all reviews written by real people are terrible. Scam. Game is a huge money suck. Was great at first. Wins were plentiful and I was spending money for fun side games. But after a certain level it just starts taking and taking with minimal win. Customer service is rude and not at all helpful when you have issues. Stay away!

This game is so unbelievably frustrating. It would be good if it wasnt consistently lagging and freezing. Every 510 min I have to restart the game bc of freezing issues. Every single time an ad plays it causes a problem. The ad either doesnt close right and crashes the game or the game freezes after closing the ad and I have to force restart it. Im almost on lvl 250 and it has been doing this since ads started popping up. I dont have this problem wany other games.

spend money and still bankrupts you to ask if you want to spend money. its literally meant to build you up then take it all real quick and then see if youll buy more to play. Ive spent a few bucks here and there only to sit here like wow. ok. why didnt I just go to the casino to just give away money? deleting. not meant for fun its meant to fool you just like a casino game to spend money. only this isnt even real ...

Ive been playing this game pretty much daily since April and I have paid for coins too many times. It seems the more you pay, the quicker you go broke. The game itself is wonderful but 300 for a decent amount of coins to continue playing is not sustainable. You can amass a lot of coins but they dont last. Save your money by not getting hooked on this lovely, addictive game.

This game is a complete ripoff. Starts fun. Seems great. Then you hit a point where you cant play without losing. Ads are the most aggressive Ive ever seen. Pop up ads begging for money. Constantly begging for money. If you pay it completely ruins the game. After you pay they constantly beg for money. Its so annoying! Its so ridiculous. DO NOT PAY TO PLAY. You will lose unless you pay after you buy. Simple as that.

Mediocre. Its painfully obvious to see you win more right after spending cash in the shop. Also whatever algorithm they use to determine wins and losses is very obvious to see its patterns. Dont waste money, and once you start losing and not getting free games, just uninstall, itll continue until you spend money or dont play for months.

I downloaded this game from an advertisement on another game. YOUR ad said that if I dont get 10 trillion coins in 10 spins, that I should delete your game. I will do that as it is IMPOSSIBLE to attain this on YOUR game in 10 spins. Maybe YOUR developers should rethink YOUR ad as it is false advertising.

This app does not reward real money purchases. It just takes what you purchased and takes it back on spins with very little reward. This is my favorite slot game, but Im going to uninstall it to save my money. Ive contacted them, and it says I have to wait 5 days for a response. Unacceptable, in my opinion only.

Game was good for the first few hours, then became a huge lose streak. On day 2, the pop up ads started as the lose streak continued. You cant even opt out of the pop up ads unless you pay, and then its only temporary. Day 3, the losing streak continues and the pop up ads have gotten worse. I will be uninstalling this game now. Do yourself a favor and save yourself the aggravation by not even bothering with this game.

Well I downloaded this game off an ad during a different game, saying within 10 spins if you dont win 10 trillion coins, uninstall the game. Huh.... Spun many times more than that and won about 200k so.....Just another lie from a game

So its nice at the start, but soon after like all other games of this type, it stops letting you win  takes all. Wins come few  under value to nothing atal. constant pop ups  ads interupt the flow. Theyll say that its randomized but nothing is randomized, its all fixed to make you lose so you spend money. Uninstalling after a week or two.

I got to play for 2 days before hitting level 90ish. Big bets started showing and better odds, but it chews through your coins very quickly. Sure, I can wait for the free coins, but this wont survive on my phone with the amount of popups ingame for me to buy more. Once the 14 day account period is over, its gone.

Ignore the fake reviews. Most of the ads are for real money games and are clearly targeted at the poor. only scum would do that. 0 stars. some interesting games but some free chip offers force you to watch an ad, and you cant kill it. Worse, after some big wins youre forced to watch an ad too.

Sucks. Just like all the other slots games, you will win HUGE in the start and then the scatter and bonus chances are removed completely to make you bankrupt and then they will ask real money from you. They ask real money the whole time, but when youre broke, you are done, unless you pay real.

I am playing this came via Freecash, and I like it. The only problems I have with Jackpotland is that it freezes a lot and the money is not real.
