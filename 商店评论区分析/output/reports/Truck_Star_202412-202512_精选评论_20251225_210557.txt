This is one of the most addictive games ever. One wish to rich upper levels until its done. Im on level 2065 thunder horse 19 ,need only 20 cars to complete all levels. And I wont play it again,it took me almost 4 months to reach this level I am at. The problem with this game is when I log in it take too long to load,fix that. Secondly,the hard levels repeat are unnecessary and a waste of time,please fix that. DISCONTINUE THIS UNBEATABLE HARD LEVELS TO MAKE THE GAME FUN TO ENJOY .

So heres the scoop, I play 3 similar style match games for reference that I spend money on , I like to support programers.Downloaded and played about 140 levels of this game. Only reason for 2stars music is good, graphics great. The game pushes you to spend money. Be careful if Google Pay is set up, you could make an accidental purchase. I like to test before purchase. As well special offer 90 Off 2.79 get you 1000coins plus tools, store 2.79 gets 2000 plus better tools? 14.99 offer same

I used to really enjoy this game, but each update seems to add more and more pointless distractions to it. Theres never ending popups about cards I care less about. Theres darts and ice buckets and cliff challenges popping up constantly. So you get into the habit of just tapping the screen to bypass it. Then they try and sneak in real money purchases in the same place. Yikes. The good parts of the game are great but all the fluff means you should avoid this in my opinion.

Fun game, and no ads! Im in the 700s for level and havent spent any money (although they really want you to). I wish it was easier to earn coins and power ups, but i also understand its a business. Only thing thats weird is the new update makes it feel like youre playing the game on Coke. Not sure why they sped it up so much, but it takes the atmosphere out of the game. It used to be nice and chill. Now its spastic. Otherwise, it would be 4 or 5 stars.

Its fun for about the first 150 levels, and then like any candy crush clone, it becomes increasingly harder and the player finds themselves in a buying funnel. Boring. Uninstalled. After their response: marketing surveys do not count as player feedback. You ask about content, not economy. You need to do USER research, not market research. You need to watch players and how they play, not ask them if they want more conversation or not. You start the survey with an NPS question. Terrible.

I dont believe in perfection so I will no longer put in 5 stars on any app or game but what I think of this game, as a trucker, theres not that much to put my teeth in but it remains a good little match 3 game. Im having fun with it. I know all the copyright issues there is avec you want to use real truck companies so i didnt expect to see real brand trucks but more customization would be good. Maybe let us drive them, for example to get to the next truck or level, hope Im clear.

there needs to be major improvements made to the truck star game like a lot of more lives a lot more moves on levels people playing on teams need to be able to play on when playing a real hard game and level on track star games would like to see this made so by the person that controls the game the person that controls the game or the person that downloaded the game on to Play store in the first place something needs to be applied and done by showing action

I started to play about a year ago creating my vehicles, hoping I would get to use them in a simulator, the way you advertise it. Ive even reached out to you on behalf of our team. You lied. You only upgrade your visual graphics, but have not added true racing teams or real simulations. You stole our ideas of thanking our team mates for gifting the cards. I praised your developers for trying......but really.....you failed us.

at first I thought I was going to enjoy the game. I liked the aspect where you could customize the vehicles that were brought in. however that changed when reward payouts were terrible, especially when you need 900 gold if you are about to lose a round. not to me tion the crazy prices when wanting to buy one of those things to help in rounds. nope I lost my interest.

Beautiful graphics, good music, and not full of ads. Yay!! Its also not the game it is advertised to be. Its a pretty good game, just not what the ad says it is. Why lie when the game itself is just fine? I dont know,but if I wanted a matching game, I would have installed one, not this. I hate to uninstall it, but I hate that they lied.

This is the most useless game you can ever play. You need to purchase coins to pass levels. The purchases sometimes fail to reflect. Whenever you are about to complete a mission, the levels get intolerably and impassibly hard. The game has poor graphics. It is too heavy for most phones RAM. It is also too large. Whatever is advertised is not what you play. You find a miserable replica of Candy Crush. If there is a game that deserves zero or at least half a star, it is this one. Downl

Its basically a match game. Its nothing like the ads for it. Which was why I downloaded it in the first place. And as far as match games go, its not too bad. Pretty easy . The in game music is very repetitive and gets old fast. There are some small elements of driving but it mostly match and build trucks. There are some parts you can customize and say that loosely, because you dont really customize anything. Not at all as advertised. But thats how Google Play is. wap wap waahhhh

This game is unfair by design stay away from it. We apply a zerotolerance policy to cheating and any kind of unethical behavior since they create inequality between players. We take immediate action. But the inequality in the progression. Of this game. You jack up the cost of the wrenches by 200 before the 3rd garage event. This is cheating as it creates an inbalance in the reward to cost ratio. This is you cheating the players from succession in your game!

The release of resources, e.g., the power ball, is overly strategic and frustrating. Coders know when and when not to release resources on the game board based on number of remains moves. When you make you last move the board floods with resources; which is their way of saying buy something. They need to make generation random. Level trickery: a hard or super hard may not be quite that hard but regular levels at times are ridiculously hard. Balance bottom line with fun youll make more .

Please let us bypass the tutorial! I never got to play your game, because I couldnt stand: 1) the endless tutorial that kept me clicking only where it let me, 2) never knowing when the tutorial would end. Most of us Dont need handholding for how a game gets configured and functions. Please give us the option to explore in our own. If you do, I will come back and replace this review.

Nice variation on match 3 games. Great with no money grabbing ads or endless game ads after every level. Down side, high cost to add extra moves per level, and as usual bomb effects are either too local or set off chain reaction,wasting potential moves. All in all,continuing to enjoy game

I love the game as a whole but my biggest problem with it is that we make very few coins per round but to continue a round it costs 900 coins the first time and even more the second time. there should be a way to watch an ad to continue or atleast knock t he price of continuing down a while lot. other than that issue I absolutely love yalls game and if you make the video continue I will most def give it 5 stars!!

First thing, the ads always show it like a truck simulator but, at the end of day its a kind of candy crush game 99 of the time. Besides of that, I played for a few days but, in a certain level is impossible to complete the games without spend money. What was quite funny and relaxing at the beginning, became something frustrating and annoying after a few days. I can recognize it is a very well structured game but, not something I look for spend time and relax without spend money.

Saw this game advertised on social media as a truck racing and action game  looked exciting with highspeed chases and stunts. Installed it expecting that experience, but its completely different. The actual game is just a car garage simulator where you change parts and match gems. Total baitandswitch! This kind of fake advertising is unacceptable. As a true fan of action and racing games, I feel totally cheated. If youre looking for real truck racing, skip this one. Developers need to be h

Good game. It would be a lot better if the rewards were more generous when completing a set of cards. Current rewards are low for such an extensive period it takes to complete each set. Also, in my opinion, maybe infinite lives should be given each time U complete a set. The reason is that it does take days or weeks to complete each set and once completed U do not get much at all. The reward ratio to the player makes it not even worth it.

fun match 3 game with good story line, great graphics for the truck. wouldve given 5 stars if it actually had game play like in the ads which got me to dl the game in the 1st place. you know, the ads where you are driving the trucks. Im on level 38 and havent done anything like that. If I didnt like all the other aspects of the game I wouldve given you 1 star and deleted the app. Stop deceiving people!!!

Why do you lie to us by showing something in your ad, but the game is completely different? do you think were that stupid, or are you that desperate? which one is it? UPDATE: what you have is a NOT a Truck game, its a Match game just like any other lame game. Theres nothing unique about you. You need to Seriously think about your integrity and honestly in advertising, and why you think you need to lie to your users. Im out immediately. Uninstalling.

While TS has potential, the difficulty spikes feel artificially inflated to push players towards inapp purchases. The incentive structure doesnt reward wins adequately, making progression slow without spending. This contrasts with games like Monopoly Go, which offer more consistent enjoyment regardless of spending. The relentless upsells create a feeling of being pressured to pay, diminishing the overall fun. Id prefer a more balanced approach where skill and time investment are rewarded.

thanks for fixing the glitching issue. there is a couple more tweeks needed done via the customizing the truck it does not show any of the currently owned trucks for the my truck option and will not allow you to scroll down to purchase or change the engine types. also the skin option after you paint the truck you cant go back to add decals or designs after changing to the new paint color. besides that its great!

game play is good, no forced ads. I play so my granddaughter can build the trucks, but once I paid for a small advantage, the difficulty skyrocketed. when I played for free it wasnt nearly as hard. easy levels take multiple tries to beat, and are basically the same as hard levels now. occasionally you get a really easy one but its rare. I thought it was because Im at level 1012, but after reading. Jims review here. I get it that its harder now because I paid for an upgrade. my mistake.

Dont expect to be driving a truck. Its a match 3 game, with a truck customization meta and one tiny truck driving mini game in first thirty minutes. Uninstalled. Ads are a lie. Match 3 loop is much the same as a million other copies. You might like the truck design theme over hotel design or garden design...

One of the best games I played. extra points for not putting annoying ads. The reason why its 3 stars and not 5 is due to some optimisation issue (truck looks like in a 480p resolution while everything else is 1080p resolution), and too many events running at the same time. I appreciate the events and they are nice, but I had a time when I had like 67 events active at the same time, and while I work to claim rewards from one event, due to long animations, makes the other event expire.

Dont waste a cent on this game, theres a tremendous amount of cheating going on in the competitions. Two weeks in a row Ive had a player start 60 or more points behind me with an hour to the end of comp and theyve scored those 60 points plus an additional 3050 points to steal the prize. Scoring like that is impossible for a person. Now the game is no longer giving wrenches so its impossible to build the trucks! 080725 current update rendered caused the game to freeze. Now unplayable.

Once you get into the 200s  up levels it makes it very hard to pass. Some are very easy but most are very hard  leave you having to use the cheats to help or fail  then give 900 coins to continue  they go up if you fail again. The next coin amount is 1900 and then up  up. Usually in a game you can buy x3 cheats for 1900 coins. In this game you only get one! Im done. Im uninstalling it, which sucks because I really do love this game.

I hate paying 900 coins to continue a level, when coins earned are limited. chance to watch video for 2x coins? larger quantity of gold coins in packswon. lower cost of continuing a level if failed? 500 is more reasonable?

Not a bad game but the customization portion is out of whack. You have to win games for wrench points, which usually are 10 pts. Then you spend 15 pts to take off tires  rims, 15 pts to put on rims, 15 pts to customize rims, 15 pts to customize center rim plate, 15 pts to paint rims, 20 pts for tires, 15 pts to paint tires. 12 games won for just tires! Then theres another 10 parts per vehicle? I played and deleted after a day. Too much play for not enough reward. Do better.

This game WAS great, I spent a good amount of money on this game. Then, I tried to open it to play it this afternoon. It would NOT open. My phone time me that the app has a bug, and that I can try to clear the cache and try to open it again. I did, it didnt work. Ive tried everything I can to get it to work, it will not open for me. Ive lost all progress and all the money I have spent on this game too. Im sure I will not see any return for my loss nor will I get any response support..

Giving 3 stars because if u like the match 3 game this is absolutely for you. If u dont like that type of game DONT PLAY THIS GAME. The promos I seen showed a truck backing up to a trailer and pulling away with the load so naturally u assume u drive the trucks and deliver loads. NO U DONT. I PLAYED FOR 2 HOURS AND DROVE 1 CAR FOR A FEW SECONDS. The match 3 is the game and u barely customize trucks cars and campers by winning the match 3 games. U dont drive anything.

I had seen ads for this game where you were driving a truck in technical maneuvers and thought that would be fun, but this game is not like that in the least. It is a simple match 3 game with a goal of tearing down and rebuilding trucklike vehicles as a story narrative. The customization options are limited, but interesting at least, granting a 3 star rating, but the game is not at all as advertised.

While the game initially offers an enjoyable experience, its progression mechanics raise significant concerns. As players advance, the difficulty curve escalates to a point where success becomes highly improbable without considerable time investment or inapp purchases that provide gameplay advantages. This design strongly suggests a primary focus on monetization, potentially at the expense of sustained player engagemet. I highly recommend avoiding this game.

Fun gameplay, with exciting  ingenious levels, great stories alongside vehicle modifying, and lots of regular events. Unfortunately, the events are coded to require nearly 247 play just to get the main reward, and half the time the developers rush it and the algorithm doesnt even offer level rewards enough to cash in for main event reward.

I enjoy the game. it does cheat though.. when you work the puzzles, it will not give any globes until the final move, then it gives several you cant use. also, the card collecting portion gives you the opportunity to exchange 250 cards for 4 cards back. 9 of 10 times, they are cards you already have. Its not really cool.. also, I really would like to have like a color grid to give more choices of colors. dont get me wrong, though. I do like the game. just needs tweaking.

truthfully, its a super fun game. I have really enjoyed it, but as you get to the higher levels, it takes either pure LUCK or money to win. This is not a hard puzzle game at all, Ive played 10x harder and had no problems, but on this one, it doesnt give you a way to win every game. great waste of time, but dont get upset if you cant beat the higher levels (300) on the 1st few tries because it is definitely rigged to an extent.

if I can make a suggestion, I think every time you finish a board instead of 10 wrenches it should be like 20, think about that ?? I also think the play on option, should be lower than 900, when you dont have enough to keep playing.

I really like this game, the graphics are amazing...However, Id like to point out something.... When I build a truck, the game asks for wrenches.... When I go and find wrenches in the game, it still asks for wrenches, and then the game suddenly closes.... Could you please fix this issue? I would really appreciate it....

I loved this game until a certain level, it becomes a cash grab. They want you to buy things at a certain point in the game and it gets way to hard. You dont really drive like they advertised and its a match game which is ok. I thought there were more mini games as well. The only reason why I give two stars instead of one is because theyre no ads. I spent money on it but I got tired of that to progress. Im going to uninstall, sorry.

I really enjoy playing. it is unique. I think the best thing about the game is that even when you ruin it off lives, you can go back and repimp your creations. one thing that I wish you could do is simulate drive your creations. the game is a great way to pass the time.

I downloaded the game fully expecting to get behind the wheel and drive, instead I had to play some casinolike nonsense to get points, then put into a garage to repair a vehicle, gave up after 5 minutes. I want to simulate driving the truck, not collect points and play in the garage. If support can help me bypass this and get to the point  I will happily revise the review.

Its controlling manipulative and deceitful and it cheats. It is heavily cash purchase driven often leaving you just short of completing a level without enough boosters or coins. It chooses what to do before it allows your requests to be executed. It monitors the chat room and no course language is allowed among many other things that average people talk about. turn off the hints otherwise it wont allow you to do your move until you decide not to do its choice which is wrong 88 of the time

This game makes you spend all of your money to continue a level, and then you dont always beat the level. Nothing is more frustrating than spending all of your money for nothing. Its a terrible design flaw, and I really hate it. If I spend money to continue a level, it would be great if it was lucrative. It really makes me feel like deleting the game from my phone and never playing it again.

Do not put a dime into this game. You will end up with a statistically improbable number of boards that require 1 more move to defeat. Requiring coins. The cost of the coins is equal to about 1 per board board. Your last move always drops energy cores to entice you to spend coins. Game has RNG stacked against you. Hard and super hard levels tend to be easier then normal boards unless you unlocked ultra energy core. Other than that its a match3 game, kinda fun

I have absolutely NO respect for a company who falsely advertises their products. The advertisement of this game makes one believe that they will be operating a driving simulator, but I encountered no such functionality whatsoever. This game is nothing more than another match3 game following the same rules as Toon Blast. I dont believe the world needs another match3 game, and copying such games and passing them off as a new type of game indicates a seriously flawed company.

An ad came up from another game I was playing, showing Truck Star. The ad that showed looked great, driving a truck trying to maneuver through the city. This is a puzzle clearing game, which I would have never downloaded. This isnt my preference of game. In my opinion, they earned this 1 star review for deceptive marketing. if you enjoy puzzlelevel clearing games, I would give it a 3. Just very run of the mill, home menu is packed full of packages to purchase and current premium events.

THIS IS NOT A DRIVING SIMULATION GAME. Ive been playing for over an hour,  I still havent driven anything. Im fixing up trucks slowly. After I finished the first truck, I still cant drive. This game is setup so u have to spend money before u can even drive. It has nothing to do with driving trucks.  Update: 8 hrs. later  I still havent driven a truck. Ive arm wrestled,  collected cards. I drove a truck in reverse for about 20 ft. This game is stupid  a waste of time.

Easy to pick the colors for the different truck items for the truck as well as choosing the tires, seat styles, and colors. This is a fun and relaxing game anywhere and anytime.

Constant disconnections from the server. 4G is not enough to maintain connectivity. This causes you to lose progress in competitions. Popups appear at the most inopportune moments, so that you ACCIDENTALLY click on the payment button for a useless package that costs a bunch of money. . You cant play for long and save up resources. You are FORCED to spend them. You will be given a combination that is IMPOSSIBLE to compile without spending resources until you spend EVERYTHING. Deleted for good

After the 1st 2 builds, the game starts to suck. If you dont start buying stupid stuff, that isnt worth the cost just to get you thru the next level. You will play any particular there after anywhere from 24 times just to get thru it. Then you waste time installing pedals, shifters and other piddly stuff to continue to waste time on a build. Im not sure which type of game is worse. Ones like this that you gotten a visa card champion or ones bombarded with ads.

despite being a complete knock off of the royal kings games, most of it is an ok to good game. issues I have are. 1) The rewards like wrenches and coins take far too much game play to accumulate (I know, they want us to pay for stuff). and getting boosters is almost next to impossible. 2) The use of power ups or piece combos does not do enough damage to the game board. 3) Dismantling and building trucks takes too many steps and wrenches to accomplish a build.

I really do think If the Ad was not misleading, my expectations would have somewhat on been so high that it messes with my whole gaming experience for the game. After fixing the 1st truck, I was stunned that I had to fix another 1 with block matching again. So yeah, Im disappointed.

An ok and fun game. but I just find it hilarious it gives you a half a board full of boosters after you take your last turn. They make it tempting you use your coins for extra moves. I guess to make us buy coins.

Just like all of these match games, you hit a certain level and it becomes too difficult to pass a level. It can take days to pass one leveling even with the help of the game tools. I dont play for the difficulty. I play to relax. Trying to pass a level over and over is not relaxing.

If you are not a Royal Match fan, and Im not. Then youre not gonna enjoy this game. Im on level 45, Ive had one simulator it was a forklift loading the back of a truck. Everything else was Royal Match  building trucks that you never get to simulate. i date at 3 stars, but Ill try a little bit longer. And maybe readjust. now Im on stage 80 and I lowered my 3 star to a one star, not worth it. You played more royal match. Ive only had 2 simulators. in 80 levels. not worth it, dont download

the levels gets to hard to quickly I use up all the boosters and coins trying to win the levels and it takes me several tries sometimes and most of the time its several days before I can win it by that time Im very frustrated and its no longer fun there is games that are easier and not so frustrating but not as fun but if I can win the levels with out the frustration thin it is worth playing and its better than this game, and I dont like playing a game online with others.

Im enjoying it very much. I dont normally like merging games, but so far this one is good. Ive only completed 2 lorries so far. One thing that would make it 5 stars was if there were more simulator games that were a little harder to do. It would also be great if you could earn points with the simulator too towards parts for the vehicles!

I changed my mind about this game. it cost too much to play for one thing. you gotta spend 900 coins to restart and it keeps going up from there and the power ups is too expensive. It was a fun game but Im uninstalling. Wish I could put 0 stars cause after a couple of levels now you gotta spend money. Not worth it anymore.

If you were baited in by an ad for a fun looking truck driver game, this aint it. Its just a copypaste of your standard issue match 3 puzzle game. Terribly disappointing. If they would just be honest about what the game is, it will find its audience, but tricking people into thinking that its something else is only going to piss people off. I mean, look at the pictures. There is nothing here that tells you what the game actually is. They sure do seem to be ashamed of it

I was liking this game until it became repetitive and same old challenges happening then it became boring. Same old decals, which would ruined the look of the cars. Replacingdecorating parts of the car that you couldnt view when completed, just seemed a waste of time. Uninstalled and looked for a more entertaining game.

fake reviews and fake advertisements. this is basically Royal King. you do puzzles and build your truck. there is NO Driving. you just play puzzles to earn wrenches to build a truck. finish the truck and move on to the next truck. just like Royal King, you do puzzles for Stars to build your kingdom. all the advertisements for this game show you with a steering wheel and driving around. no where in this game can you do that.

its incredible how many different ways this game actually cheats. Sometimes the game will just pretend you didnt match 5, and delete the tiles. Other times, it will delete random tiles during tile falls so that the tiles align differently than they actually wouldve if it wasnt cheating... once you get to a high enough level, you will see it easily with the naked eye. You can use screen recorder to prove it. The game cheats just to ensure you have to buy, or lose your streak. Crooked as hell.

if you download this game, DO NOT buy extra coins. I did that a few times, and then i noticed they charged my card three months in a roll the same price. Ive never ordered extra coins that cost that much. the most i ever spent was 7.99 and plus the tax. but my account showed that charge and then a 16.00 charge three months in a roll. Ive never spent that much. and Ive never bought coins that much anyway, maybe a couple of times. thieves, so I canceled and deleted the app. its really sad

Deceptive Advertising! After seeing several ads depicting a driving game, showing a truck trying to navigate a mountain road with rickety wooden bridges and other vehicles I thought I would give it a try. As it turns out, it is yet ANOTHER jewel matching game, identical to at least a halfdozen others. It even has the exact same bombs, propeller and other power ups. Ive played 40 levels, built two trucks to completion and the only driving done has been to move a truck a short distance.

Just another match3 clone of the hundreds of other games just like it. Very deceptive ads show a completely different game, and never mention anything about it being a basic matching game. There are dozens of games exactly like this one, because its built on the same core the developer uses for a bunch of other games. It also has the same shady coding that prevents you from advancing once you have purchased ingame credits until you have used all of the credits you purchased. Deleted.

Great game until about level 400. Somewhere around there the difficulty goes through the roof and its just frustrating every time I pick it up. Then you get a Hard level not to mention the Super Hard levels. Might as well just use all your coins and specials . Im giving up at around level 530 because every level is stupid hard.

Even with subscription its nice game ,even when reach the superb levels and extras. a bit disappointed otherwise lovely.

Fun game mostly, you definitely have to pay to get past some levels. sometimes bombs dont do anything. needed 1 space cleared (just 1) put the 2 biggest bombs together right next to the space and it was still there, lost the round. Havent played the game since. now I know its pay to play.

These games catch you by advertising a completely different game. You dont get to drive a truck for 99 of the game, but instead play a copycat of Royal Match winning wrenches to rebuild a truck until youre done and it gives you another truck to fix. Then, when you do rarely drive the truck, its nothing like the advertised gameplay.

I play a few match 3 games and this one is in my top 5. The main part for me is the option to turn the hints off. The idea of the game is very good and the chance to rebuild and customise a truck is excellent. Kudos goes to the developers and everyone else involved in making this great game. Well done.

Its a fun game. NO ads. Its a keeper! my only issue is that ALL the events, prizes, and truck build parts are based on completing levels in the match 3 board. If you get stuck on a hard level, there is absolutely nothing to do.

Lately any power ups, not doing what theyre designed to do, especially when down to last moves. convinced they do this to sell their wares. I completed over 1600 levels before I uninstalled. Even the easy levels are acting up. My 5 year old grandson loved playing it, but lately not so much. Not wasting any more time. Toal waste.

My WordZee game never came back because This ad will NOT return you back to your game. No matter how many times I hit the X, it takes me repeatedly to Google Play where an odd narrow grey space at the bottom of the screen appears every time. Hit the  arrow and the loop begins over and over unnecessarily, maybe 10 times. Fix this frustrating glitch so I can return to MY WORDZEE game. Another ad by Amazon on other games does the same thing.

Not A Fan Of Forced Ads! meaning if you want to just want to receive the regular payouts without wanting the bonus money which if you do you have to watch an ad thats fine but when you dont select the bonus option you still have to watch an ad thats Force ads in my book no matter what your Forced to watch ads.

This game falls short of expectations and truly feels chaotic. I strongly advise against investing your time or personal data in it. Contrary to what the title suggests, it is not a driving truck simulation; instead, it is primarily a puzzle game that requires more strategy and problemsolving than actual driving mechanics. After giving it a chance, I found myself frustrated and disappointed with the direction it took.

After level 400 it just became really hard and not enjoyable. You barely have any health and so youre implied to spend money. Also, when you have only few objectives left and no moves, this trucker just pops out best stuff, meaning you have to spend coins to get additional 5 moves. Its frustrating and dishonest once you see these patterns.

There is no way in hell that this game has a 4.7 rating! Im calling bs on that. This is just another Candy Crush knockoff! I am so sick of apps creating fake ads for another stupid match three game. It looked really fun in the ad but it was really really stupid. It was a disappointment it wasnt near as fun as what the ad look like

This games algorithm makes it difficult if you dont top up. All games released by this developer are the same, they all want to make as much profit as possible. Playing games to have fun actually makes you stressed ... game paling tolol....beli booster bukannya keluar saat main, enggak keluarnya nanti setelah langkah nya selesai

This game requires more luck than skill, or power ups which of course cost real world money. You can of course earn some by playing. To summarize, a fun game marred by being luck based instead of real skills.

Ive played many matching games and this is one of the few with challenging but not impossible levels. Ive made it past level 3000 without spending a penny on any power ups. Even if you run out of lives, you can still play the vehicle restoration portion of the game, which, is surprisingly detailed, and definitely elevates it past other matching games.

False Advertisement. Its just a match game where you build trucks. I thought after the truck was built, wed have more of the game play advertised. Nope. Just another truck to build. Played 20 levels so maybe it gets better? But not at all what was advertised. If I have to play 50100levels to get the game play I expected, the game isnt worth the time.

Being one of the highest rated players in the game. Take this review seriously!!! This game is an absolute money grab. DO NOT SPEND 1. Once you spend real money the developers have coded the game to either force you to buy or deplete what youve earned and make the gameplay impossible to move ahead. PREDATORY MONETIZING AT ITS BEST!

This is a horrible game of which Ive played similar many times before. uninstalling after 20mins. This game is so monotonous and so gone. Do better.

Sure, it is an interesting game. However, it does not offer any free coins by watching ads. They want you to always join this, and that not to forget to buy coins left right and center. I only made two lowpriced purchases, but it is not enough in the long run.

avoid it. its a pay to win once you start playing its not a bad game until every other level is rated at a hard or super hard so either you stop playing or start spending money. either make the game free or charge for it get away from microtransactions.
