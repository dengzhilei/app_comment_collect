Absolutely brilliant! Hay Day combines relaxing farm gameplay with deep strategy, and it hits the sweet spot just right. You build up your own farm from scratchplanting crops, raising animals, crafting goodsand the vibrant graphics and smooth controls make it a joy. What I love most: The freedom to decorate and personalize your farm so it reflects your style. The trade and social featuresjoining neighbourhoods, helping friends, competing in derbiesadd replay value and connection.

Great game with beautiful graphics and relaxing gameplay. I have a few suggestions that could make the game even better. Please add oneclick animal feeding and a machine queue system to save time. Barn expansion materials feel too rare. The newspaper needs better item variety. Toms 12hour sleep reduces his valueallowing 6 continuous uses would be better. These small changes would greatly improve the experience. Ive been playing this game since 2017.

This little farm game is so fun and addictive!! Its satisfying growing your farm, and you unlock so many animals and stations as you progress. I LOVE the art style it is so silly and cute. You can interact with other players and help them complete orders, and put your own items up for sale too! There are cool events and daily tasks to complete as well. If youre on the fence about getting this game, I highly recommend it!! Im only a couple days in but Im having a blast.

It reminds me of the old Facebook game of the same name, which is more I can say for other FB era games. They still focus on decorations that look good for your farm and it doesnt have many cash grab feelings like many other games. However, the new update seems rather redundant, I hope this isnt a bad omen for the game. the only improvement was the ability to get rid of queued items in the production lines. I hope they dont change any of the existing game and looks or get rid of fun events.

I would give it 3 stars because I love the game but it would be better if youre able to sell the items you get for rewards instead of just storing it and never using it, I got fences I dont care for but instead of being able to sell it, its just in my storage and will never get used. if your friend needs help with something youre not able to help because you have be at the same level as your friend, you need to wait to get to level 45. it would be good if you can help with what you have.

There are a few things that I would like to mention. 1. In birthday theme why they have to gift scarecrow, I mean its a birthday day not Halloween theme 2. In the photo booth, many people dont follow theme and add stuff that is not even related to theme or dont even try to decorate but get a lot of votes because we have to choose between two pictures to collect reels. Isnt it unfair to the ones who follow theme and try their best to decorate it in a creative and beautiful way?

no doubt about it, this game is cool, the decorations now added give the game extra meaningful play and look awesome theres too much to do tho, even in standard game play theres 5 or 6 things to be trying to achieve like boat orders truck etc, but now the Devs add other tasks too which sometimes its too much I end up not playing some and it can get frustrating missing out also further up the levels u go theres too much demand on the milk,eggs bacon supply so needs more farm animals!

The game is good but there are some bugs that need to be handled. If a person has finished upgrading the town and does not need the tools or the map pieces, the user should not receive it as a reward from anywhere. The rewards in the game should be coded based on the user. And if the user tries to buy any upgrade part that he has need of, at least show a message saying the user does not need this user part as he has already finished upgrading. Even after this if the user buys, thats fine

Third class game with mismatched teammate and This 3rd class chapri app is a fraud. You made so much progress by wasting so much time but if the task is not completed on time then all the hard work goes to waste. At least there should be an option to add time for player and Make sure the events are searchable when the event time is short and this can be lifesaver. This deserves a rating of nothing less than 0 stars.

I truly enjoy playing Hay Day! Its engaging, relaxing, and beautifully designed. However, I hope future updates can include a viewflip or rotation feature to make farm layout and design more convenient. Additionally, the mine, nets, and production buildings feel quite expensive, while the product values and production times seem disproportionately low and lengthy. I hope the developers can consider rebalancing these aspects to make the overall gameplay experience even more rewarding.

Gotta love a game where you win a prize and are immediately made to throw it away or pay to keep it. If I pay for it, its a purchase, not a prize, and we should be given the option to activate the free and found boosters rather than throw them away. So glad to have won 3 boosters for filling 3 boats, and made to throw them all away, or pay to keep. They shouldnt have been considered free or found, I worked for them, they were an event prize.

My Valley hasnt been opening and now I am missing the Sanctuary Valley. I tried contacting SuperCell by email, but I got a response back saying that I needed to contact them through the game. Well, contacting them through the game doesnt help either. There are only a few things to choose from,  when you click on one, you get an automated response. Also, I have already cleared the cache, cleared the data, uninstalled, reinstalled, and switched devices. Maybe I will update the stars when fixed.

love the game however, I think it would be great if you could make helping other farms easier to see where the help us needed when visiting a farm. some farm are extremely full and busy and its impossible to find the exclamation mark. May be you should taken straightdirected where the help is needed or have it bigger and a different colour? otherwise fun game

I got this game because I love farming.It is a great game but I newbie would be little annoyed by the amount of time you have to wait for certain things.Can you please add an option to skip the tutorial,I created a baby farm and I was so annoyed when that young lady was teaching me how to play the game.Ohh and some products are really ridiculous and unnecessary I mean come on what is a fancy cake?I appreciate the creativity but lets stick to normal products please. Nonetheless... Great game!

I think that every time we want to buy the product we want, it is sold to someone else, because whenever I need something and try to buy it, it does not give it to me even though I touch it, and I think that the game should put the product we need in the market, and also as an update suggestion to the game, credit should come to make it easier for the players. And also why is everything paid? Thats really annoying.

All gone wrong since the update! It was a great game but since the update today, its all gone wrong! It keeps crashing. Its not recognising my collection tasks when i do them, so i have to do it again. The adverts now open a web page and take you to the Play store which is annoying. Most phone games are awful, this WAS a rare gem. Now Ill have to quit. Tried to report the bugs, but the text box is under my phone buttons on the screen. You need to move the text box up, so i can actually reply

Boo! I really liked the old update where they reduced the times for a lot of things. It made everything very convenient and flow very well. And theyve removed all of it! And made the truck order board ugly and harder to read  special orders should be a different colour! Really unhappy with this update I hope they undo it  maybe theres a happy middle to be found between the really short times of the old update and the boring new one.

I have been playing this game for years off and on and this game has always been really fun. I love the dynamic of the game, but the only thing now that frustrates me a lot is all those Bots that just sell Sugarcane . They flood the whole newspaper servers and I cant even buy any other product because there is only sugar cane available. I wish Supercell would do something about this because I feel like it is not fair for regular players trying to enjoy this wonderful game.

Recent updates have taken away from my experience. Graphics are great  fun for all ages. Cropanimal tasks are smooth  fast. Sadly, the screen is so full its getting harder to find  use tools,  to see the whole farm. Lately, production tasks start  are in process for several minutes, but if I leave and come back, disappear. My internet was stable at those times! I keep losing the ability to speed production by watching ads. The option is grayed out even though not used recently.

Only downside takes forever to add more land its ridiculous, need 3 things x16 each just to add more land, plus trees and rocks has to removed on top of that... Have to buy diamonds to get anywhere.... Level up the rewards should be better then just getting more items to add to your farm its like Where I can I put the machine

you cant sell items from your barn and silo out right to make space for more needed items . have things I dont need and so far selling things at the road side stand doesnt really work yet for me . had stuff there sell for 2 days now. UPDATE whats the use of Neighbor Groups if you dont have a private room to chat and trade stuff like most farm games . most have private room and a world room to shop and trade in .

The game was great for a while, til I had to keep shelling out real money for fake stuff in the game...then there is the fact ads no longer work for me. Id been using them to get free help I need for rewards or cut down time to make something. Please find out the issue and FIX it, and I will give a better review. I play this game with my nephews. Im an adult, so the ads should not have stopped working for me.

This game sucks! The SupportDevelopers never address game issues, bugs, etc. Their responses are from AI which is so lame.They always want screenshots or a video. Even when provided,nothing is done! Boat crateTruck fill rates are 12 of what you can sell the product for in your stand! Events are geared towards people who spend  on the game! Well some people dont have the income to warrant that! DiamondsGame  should be an option to use! Not 1 response to any reviews from Developers.Pathetic

amazing game! All of the events are fun, even the shorter ones. I usually buy the pass because the stuff and decorations is worth it to me. one thing tho, I wish that I could place decorations on top of stone roadspaths. I love decorating my farm and making intricate spots, so this would add so much.

The game has been funfair until the beginning of this yr. Now tasks are asking the impossible and diamonds are needs,in the Derby and other events you are competing against much higher level game plays,who just win everything.But the most frustrating aspect right now,after the Blueberry infestation which has now magically disappeared,is the ad mag is now bombarded with low level Botfake accounts just selling sugar cane,between 2045 ads in each mag! We should be able to totally block these.

I dont know what happened. I had once deleted the app previously, not my account. So, I should have access to that account right. I downloaded the app today and they had an option to choose your previous account or current one. I chose the previous and wrote confirm but I was at 30 something level and now I am at 1. The supercell ID that I used says that it doesnt exist. Very disappointed, I really wanted to play the game again but not from square one.

Its fun wish I could have gone to my original farm dont really care to have to wait on town visitors to get reward or pay so dont bother to go there and dont like that you dont get coins when doing business in the country part of the game and last dont like getting just a screw or board when using your rewards through the gift catalog its a waste need more diamonds or cash but its a fun way to pass time

I have played this game for the past 7 years. The game was amazing. Neighborhood members are active have fun and help each other. Meet international friends from many countries like Australia, Malaysia, Singapore, America etc... Developers need to fix some bugs during data connections while the farm process is lost in slow connections. Developers may fix the conversation area because some messages are sent without touching and it hurts because the neighbour feels so sad.

The derby needs to go, cant be won. The farm pass you pay 11.99 a month but you cant keep the barn  silo storage increases, that just wrong. What are the land permits used for? Tried to take your survey wouldnt let get pass the 5th question. I have never gotten the prize after watching your update videos, and Ive tried. The game is just not enjoyable as it once was, it has gotten very tedious.

Hay Day is such a relaxing game! I love planting crops, feeding animals, and decorating my farm. The graphics are super cute and colorful. Its fun to trade with neighbors and unlock new buildings.

Restocking is not the same as rotating. And why can we not continue in the games, you need to take the limits off, so we still have something to do. Maybe add a little something different its getting kinda Routine. I currently have quit buying diamonds because of the routine of the game. Cost Me Too! Much money to keep doing the same things over and over and over again at this time my gifts for helping seem to be frozen

The updates are really Trash. why they released such updates here some get the benefits of it and others dont. Just an empty update. Additionally, this Help and support system is only there for showcase, you ask for help and they reply We are on it . Such a shame that whoever is working on hayday they just care about that game should be running, and dont care what players feedback should be. It is such a shame. Rating wise I would give in Negative rather than Positive.

Hi, I have been playing Hay Day for a while. I truly love the new updates that have come out like the blueberries. I also love that I found a helpful team that participates in the derby and shows great teamwork. I adore my farm neighbors they are so helpful too. I wish the fishing event were still happening with all the rare fish and amazing prizes. Also, do the fish ever weigh more than 4 pounds? I havent caught one bigger than that.

There is a glitch in your Daily Dirt whereby the same farm shows up 5 times advertising the same items. That has changed from the past where the same farm would only show up twice. You need to do an update. Also on Saturday October 4th, I purchased some nails and duct tape from Witch Hat Giftes and they never added to my nails and duct tape. Why is that? It happened in the past week also. I am losing witch hats that I worked for.

Just like the other reviews are saying, the majority of the shorter production times have changed from 5 min to 2 hours and some of my crops have gone from 15 min to 4 hours. This ridiculous change is going to make it impossible to finish the collection task board when one task take 6 hours to complete. At this point, this game cant be played for more than 10 min at a time unless you spend money.

it is a very fun game with many challenges and tasks task to complete I love how there are levels and when you finish a certain challenge or goal you can level up your house and your farm I read it four stars not five because I do not like how you have to get some things with diamonds and when you first join you have either 20 or 30 then it tells you to spend them then youre left with none and have to get someone your own which is hard but you do get one every level you pass

Hello devs, the game is fun but try and understand that after playing for some time you start getting bored cause no new type of events and the present events are all too hard to complete  please add new type of events because the game is same stuff you can do over and over and over so you need a few fun and easy weekly events that keep you motivated to play everyday

why cant we have a second dairy? I cannot produce enough cheese, butter, etc to make other products ever. I need 2 so I can be producing double. Ive been playing for awhile now and I love it but its getting harder and harder to play and is starting to be less fun. also I cant keep up with the dead trees and bushes without spending real money. other farming games I play I can get diamonds for free. but I barely get any for free in this game.

For some reason Im having trouble getting into the valley part of hay day and this continues to happen. I have updated and uninstalled and reinstalled. I dont know what is going on. Otherwise I love the game. Now this game says to update and I will receive diamonds for the update. I have not received the diamonds for the update. I do not like the update at all. Now game is forcing me to update AGAIN IT HAS TAKEN ALMOST 20 MINUTES and its not finished yet!! That is ridiculous!!!!!

When people say do not help other people out . Some people are giving some stuff to other people and when I dislike this game big time I think you need to watch all these people on this game because they are giving information to other people . Some people are so rude like Sofia . I am going quite this game because I cant deal with rude people sorry .

its a fun relaxing game. Ive been playing this since the late 00s. I love it so much, but please, add a chatroom to each friend. Sometimes I wanna ask my friends in the game whether they have something and can sell it to me or not, but theres no way to contact them. The neighbourhood helps with that, but not all of them are helpful and nice, some are just taking advantage of the derbys prizes. So please, add a chatroom with our friends. Thank you.

As an avid player of farming simulation games, Ive spent countless hours tending to virtual crops and livestock. While Hay Day has its charms, it also presents several persistent issues that significantly detract from the overall experience, especially when compared to other games in the genre. My friends who play alongside me share these sentiments, indicating a common dissatisfaction within our farming community. Tedious Loading and Harvesting Times One of the most disappointing matter.

the game used to be a fun farm game which involved a weekly derby, monthly farm pass event  sanctuary. Now supercell is pushing out too many task events, which requires spending money to progress through, sometimes there have been two task events and the derby to cope with in the same week.The way that the game is at the moment is burning people out  players will leave the game if it continues to be like this. Many players have jobs or school

I love this game and have been playing on and off for some time. Recently started playing again and the only thing I really wish is that once youre neighborhood is made you could change the name somehow. I dont mean my personal farm name, I mean the neighborhood where derbys are held. This would be very helpful. I finally have a name Id like for my neighborhood to be however I would have to start the neighborhood all over to change the name.

A few days ago, I was curious about how many years Ive been playing Hayday. I knew it had been a long time but didnt know the exact number. Coincidentally, you guys put out a special Highlights event and I found out Ive been playing for almost 9 years. With all the ups and downs in my life, Hayday has been my peaceful escape. And I just wanted to thank you guys from the bottom of my heart Thank you so much to Hayday team for creating such cozy and comforting game and all cute decorations.

Been playing this game on and off for years and would really give it a 5 star rating but come on guys just trying to get out of an add after watching it for a reward is a really irritating. It takes you directly to playstore a few times before you are finally able to get back to your game or having to close the game completely just to get rid of the damn add. The end result of is I simply stopped watching the ads which I assume is something that you will not find is helping you revenue at all.

hi, very disappointed and angry with developers, still asking for too much for virtual decs. Did the new update and its telling me I have a frozen tile which I dont. Dont like the new truck order update its too small please put it back as it was. I think its stupid asking for real cash for unreal decs which make it unable to complete collections most of the time. Game play needs to be fair for all not just people who can afford to pay real cash. Stupid orders ask for too much as usual.

Dont spend money on diamonds. I regularly spent money to get diamonds for years. But recently they added new events that seemed to conflict with the game play, (like soybeans growing in a minute instead of 20 minutes) or losing diamond purchases. About 3 weeks ago I opened up my game to find that my surplus of diamonds (over 350) was wiped out to absolute 0. I made various inquiries with no answer. So my suggestion is to enjoy the game... Buy diamonds at your own peril.

Id give a 5 star bc I absolutely love this game! The biggest downfall is the farmer market thingy, theres never what you need, and apparently I click at the same time as everyone else in the game and dont get the resource... theres a lot of lag which also makes the newspaper worthless bc you everyone got everything while the game lagged so you just have to wait. Lots of waiting. btdubs love the Blueberries.

The inappropriate behavior of a toxic player was reported but nobody is doing anything about it. I reported through email, sent messages in game , and reported the inappropriate text in game but theres no consequence and the player kept bullying everyone in the neighborhood since the leader is not active, theres no furthermore action. I have sent you the proof screenshots too. This should be relaxing and family friendly game.

I have really been enjoying this game. I was disappointed in the other game I was playing (township) because it lost direction and got boring.. I decided to try this as its somewhat similar and have been glued to it. I do get discouraged at how difficult it is to obtain expansion tools like stakes, deeds, duct tape. it seems like I try so hard for days and says to get ONE. With that being said, I love how the decorations are always rotating to keep collecting fun. theres always something do.

I really love this game! The graphics, gameplay, and farming mechanics are great and very relaxing. One small issue Ive noticed is that when planting apple, cherry, or raspberry bushes, etc. they die after a few harvests. It would be amazing if you could introduce a fertilizer maker or treecare system to help maintain them for longer. That would make the experience even better! Keep up the great work!

If you modify these features then it will awesome. 1) In game decoration price increments if you can remove this then we can design our base beautifully. 2) some decoration is of diamond if this item can available in coins. like low level player cannot afford to design base using diamond. 3) In edit mode if we can multiple select object and move them. like select a area and move them from here and there. 4) Last point instead of diamond we can use coins to upgrade slots of the machine.

its fun at first, but they purposely make it where you need more and more resources to sell items, but prevent you from building storage to hold those resources. plus, the in game currency you get from selling items is a different currency than what you have to pay to get building materials. its entirely there to get you hooked and spend gobs of money just to keep playing. uninstalled. not surprised given Supercells history.

My favorite part of the game is decorating my farm, but I absolutely hate that things go up in price after buying. for example, the brown fence has gotten so expensive...

super fun. I really enjoy the game.. just one problem. if someone pays the full amount of diamonds for TOM for the longest time frame.... his rest should be a lot shorter not still 2 hours... I buy diamonds to increase in the game but still get penalized with the long weight times for doing so..Please reduce Toms rest time for the max rental..5 stars if this is done

Overt Misandry, clunky and poorly designed UI. Graphics are mediocre and generic, It is obvious this is the JV team at supercell. I would say the gameplay is fun, it is, but its farming. I realize its a kids game, but what are we doing to the pigs? This machine cuts bacon off of them? And they get skinny? i mean come on. And when we get eggs the chickens react as if post coitous? These peope have some serious problems that I dont want my child absorbing.

update 7425 What the hell is up with the lame gift from the gifts catalog? You save up 35 tickets from helping farmers and then hay day gives you a small tree or log pile or a light post. I dont understand after 11 years of playing how lame some things are. Also customer service or help doesnt help whatsoever. Dont even try with them.

Honest Review  Hay Day is still fun, but its starting to feel outdated. The UI needs a refresh, and there are few new bonuses or features. With a more modern update, the game could be much more lively.

I hate having to craft (4) of the same thing, having to wait hella hours for it to finish, only to accidentally collect one or two before Im able to grab the proper ticket for it.

I did love this game but am growing very frustrated with it. There is an event going on right now that started yesterday but the daily tasks available will be impossible to win any of the prizes toward the end. Also, if a derby task is selected to serve certain town visitors, then that visitor will no longer arrive on a train. The algorithm is set against anyone winning anything. Very disappointed.

I think this game is generally quite enjoyable, but the fact that certain decorations, which are used to unlock rewards when collected in certain groups, are locked behind a paywall. I have no problem with decorations in general costing money, I wont buy them, of course, but since theyre ornamental it doesnt matter. The fact that they stand in the way of completing ingame challenges does get annoying, though, and it makes it impossible to complete those challenges if you dont pay

I have played this game since before it was played only through Facebook and still find it enjoyable and fun to play. Other than a few dollars (less than 10.) once in a great while, no actual money needed and Ive been playing for the past 12 years. Yes, it takes longer to level that way, but it is not a race to see how fast you can get to the next level. Its a lay back, relax and enjoy

The game is fun, but the makers have been having problems with glitches for several months and will not respond to players when we file a help or trouble shooting ticket. The glitches for me has been my inability to watch ads all of a sudden. This really impacts game play by not being able to earn extras in the game such as coins, reduced production time, and expansion items. Its handicapping me in everyday play and in special task events.

Love Hay Day , but they still have not fixed the game on losing items that are needed for an order to be completed and when you send the truck out with a different order you lose items for a different order. I stopped playing Hay day as often as I did ( multiple times a day) and started playing other games. when I came back to Hay Day just about All of my diamonds were gone, I had 200 diamonds why pay for them if youre just going to be ripped off of them.

Really fun farming game. However when I started playing again about a month ago I had reduced times for some crops to grow (soybeans and sugarcane for example) and also some reduced production time compared to when I played about a year ago. This hugely improved my experience with the game but is now gone back to the old time making the game much less fun for me and I dokt really understand why this has changed, the reduced times werent marked as a seasonal or booster effect or anything...

Ive been playing this game for many years. Loved it. Now its just getting greedy. You have to purchase diamonds to be able to get all the decorations. The longer you play the more it gets greedy. When doing special events the items they ask for is ridiculously high and they are items that take forever to make. Its not enjoyable anymore. You can work very hard and feel like you are getting no where. Always needing to pay money or use diamonds to complete special events and get bonus items.

gone down hill since the last upgrade, the market place definitely has glitches with many products appearing available but when you try to purchase them theyre actually already sold. you can no longer watch an advert to cut the speed of production and on the off chance that you do, it freezes the game. many more things wrong now and its always been a greedy game (pay diamonds to open a box and get 1 stick of dynamite which i get free for seeing to my pets and the townies!)

Its ok but falls right into the trend of these types of games. You literally feel when you get to a point where the only feasible way to progress is to spend money. You can make all other resources in the game but to increase storage on your farm, ironically the most important aspect to leveling up, the resources cant be made. You get a piece of wood, not from chopping trees, but from harvesting pumpkins for example... excuse me but HUH!?

Ive been playing Hayday since 2014. This includes money Ive paid that contributes to your ongoing success. I know that I am nothing to you and I almost didnt make the effort to write until I realized that, that would make me nothing even to myself. You have taken up so much of my visual field in this game that I can no longer deal with it. I play using a 6 or so screen. Youve taken the fun! Go look at my farm.

Charming and wellmade, but it pushes players too much toward buying diamonds. Many features feel locked behind them, making progress slow unless you pay. Long production timers also make the game hard to enjoy casually. Instead of relaxing minutetominute play, it often becomes a cycle of waiting. A beautiful game, but too dependent on diamonds and patience.

Great graphics, no other game can compete But because theres little competition, they have grown complacent and greedy, prices will be different in the supercell store for different accounts They fix things that are not broken, e.g. the lastest update changed truck orders into a tiny paper, I can barely see the orders Overall, great game to kill time, but poor company that handles it

Best. Game. Ever. There are no forced ads in this game. You can watch an ad to speed up your production machines, but its entirely your choice to do so, or not. The monthly events are so fun, and again, you choose how much of it you do. The graphics and gameplay are really many levels above any other comparable game, in my humble opinion. I have been playing on and off for around 10 years, and  it just as much as when I started, even more. It has been my happy place for a long time now.

I love Hay Day, but I am writing to you to signal a problem that I encounter with my roadside shop. It seems that I cant set the actual maximum prices for products. When I try to sell pumpkins, the maximum price available is 108 coins, while other players can sell the same item for 324 coins. The same goes for corn and chili peppers, maybe more, but I havent discovered it yet. Im level 38,and Ive noticed that even players with lower or higher levels can set it higher.

The biggest problem by far is the newspaper like 80 of it is just wheat you never find anything you actually need. Supercell should really implement some kind of global market system like RuneScape or hypixel has.

The game play itself is really cool,inviting friends and family is even better. Interaction with multiple mixed people,and using social skills not only to help others on the game ,but finally help one another out

there seems to be an issue with playing ads. once you have watched a certain paticular type of ad you cant escape from it afterwards having to then completley shut down the game just to progress further. seems to have only started since the newest xmas update! please fix!

I was loving hay day but now, well now its become underwhelming. I had frozen tiles that would help me in the holiday decorations event but now it says that I no longer own it. Why? I didnt sell it  I was never even able to use it. I have a screen shot so where are my frozen tiles?

recently picked this back up and now Im reminded of why I stopped playing in the first place, the whole storage upgrade thing just ruins the game Im literally stuck on level 15 because I cant do anything even if you wanna keep that mechanic in the game the very least you could do is give players a way to craft or buy (not from other players) the materials needed for the upgrades because once the storage is full you cant do anything in the game

This game is really fun to play. Although, sometimes it is boring when youre done with all task available to do. The waiting hour for each item to be ready is too long for me. I also have this one experience just now. I bought this one specific item because I need it. But because Im short in coins, I used my gems. But someone already bought it first, now the gems I used are lost but I didnt received any items. Its just like I wasted 8 Gems for nothing.

ads to reduce times are being taken away or something, always grayed out now and I just will stop playing. I am not gonna spend money on this silly game and it takes hours for every little thing and now the option to watch ads is constantly grayed out. Bye I guess. This has been an issue for over a year, having uninstall and reinstall the entire game to get ads back for time reduction. They very much know about it amd have done nothing to fix it.

I love the game, I just have one suggestion for seasonal machines. if a person purchases additional slots on the production machine it should always roll over whenever it is available for the next season. You shouldnt have to purchase new production slots every season. (Example: Halloween candy machine)

hey guys just wanted to ask u all , hay day doesnt let you expand even after level 22 right? they ask for 3 items , each item requirement is 16 ( 16 per item ) , and without that u cant right? and u can only get these items mostly through diamonds , which obv we as players dont have much in general, so basically they want us to buy from our real money those diamonds and get the land ( expansion )...am I right? and if yes then because of this reason , I am rating this game a 3 instead of a 45

Ive had this game for years and always loved it dearly, until the latest update. Downloaded it, only for the game to stop loading at all because unable to download new game content, check for storage space. I do have so much free space, so this doesnt make sense. Its been a few days and the issue persists. Tried deleting and redownloading the game, clearing cache, data...same issue. I cant open the game and play anymore and its really disappointing and annoying. Id appreciate any fix!!!

This game has so much potential but why tf does it not allow me grow crops to my wish. So basically if I grew 1 corn before, now I can only plant one more corn? We have lives outside of this little gimmick. We just log in occasionally to check if everythings alr. Basically you forced me to delete this game because theres no way we have to constantly be on the game for it to yield results. it makes it much more boring that it already is. Please fix it and forgive me if I was being rude.

Leuk spel nog steeds alleen ALTIJD problemen met de derby. (Aan het einde van de derby kan je spullen kiezen. dit kan ik pas als een nieuwe derby gestart is en ik krijg vaak andere spullen als dat ik gekozen heb.) en ik vind ook dat bij evenementen waar je dingen kan kopen voor apparte valuta ik best vaak veel niet kan kopen omdat ik te weinig van die valuta kan vrijspelen. Jammer. Maar ondanks alles is het wel een leuk spel dat ik bijna dagelijks speel.

Peaceful play at times, but theyve MONETIZED EVERYTHING especially the things you actually need Ive been playing since it was released and I DEFINITELY see the difference. Last I checked this was a childrens game and I dont recall children having jobs or whose parents give them an unlimited bank card. THE LAST THING WE NEED IS MORE MONEY LEAVING OUR POCKETS IN 2025.

It was kinda confusing at first, I was so sad and uninstalled it because I searched for a tutorial on a specific thing and no one really helped me, after a few days I downloaded it back and tried to figure it out again, (ofc I get overwhelmed). the diamond is so hard to get and yet its the important ones to buy stuff when u run out of things. the proceed is really long, and the silo thing gets on max easily, but the game is fun, I guess.

It would be great if Hay Day allowed us to produce storage upgrade and land expansion items within the game using equipment, instead of relying only on finding or buying them. This would make the game more fun and less frustrating.

A decent game to pass time and play with others. I only have a few gripes. For one, the rewards for the derby are absolutely shocking, even if you come in first place theres no point in bothering with it. Secondly, the game is very poorly balanced. New crops and craftable items take hours and hours to grow but are only worth a tiny bit more than the last unlock. Lastly, needing to pay diamonds to unlock more derby tasks is shamelessly pay to win. Pure greed by the developers.

One day I was bored and decided to download Hay Day and try it out based on friends recommendations. It was really worth it. Hay Day has become one of the games I play the most on my phone. It is essentially a game that consists into building your own farm layout with coins you get from selling products... But heres the twist: Theres way more gameplay mechanics, temporary or seasonal missions and even a clan chat system to play with friends in numerous events. Very entertaining and casual!

I have played Hay Day for years. I enjoy it. It is a relaxing game. Whatever they did with ads lately has reduced my appreciation for it, and if the problem persists, I may stop playing.

I would like to give 5 star rating for the game, but their support system made me give 1 star. I have lost access to my gmail account connected to Supercell id in which I played both Hayday and Clash of clans at good levels. When I tried to recover through support chat, everytime a bot appears which is of no use.

Best game ever I played! Firstly, the decorations are the BEST! Secondly, I love how there are pets for you, which makes it even fun! Thirdly, I love how the theme changes every month, which makes it exciting and interesting! But, I think I feel that can enhance the game experience to include night mode. For example, maybe you can choose your day mode. Also, the expansion for land is quite expensive... As it is NOT easy to get the expansion materials... Overall, best game I ever played!

They created a game thats a full time job. Events are impossible without spending or luck. The task event they love to constantly have will use one machine multiple times and take 18 hours to complete. So if youre not lucky in prepreparing and having what you need in the exact order, get ready to spend if you want to finish.

Cute farming game. Love decorating my farm. This is my longest played mobile game. I started playing it about 10 years ago. Im thankful its not fully of ads, and you dont have to spend money in order to progress in the game. That is why I still play the game. I have bought a few things here and there, but it is not necessary to do so.

Dear Hay Day, are we cooking food or ageing cheese?? Why does Fish Pie take 5 HOURS? Is my farmer fishing in another country? Cabbage Soup takes 4 HOURS are we growing the cabbage in real time?? Meanwhile Lobster Soup: 7 minutes. Who is in charge of this logic? I just wanna talk.  And THEN you reduced the prices of items like Egg Sushi, Tomato juice and cherry juice. So let me get this straight: Takes longer to make Earns less coin Events become impossible Player lose brain cells

Love the new updates and goodies galore. Puzzle pieces for me and the new blue flowers to obtain more. no other game offer so much for free. can obtain things realistically. Years to complete 1 task without payment is not a game. Thank you. I dont have money unfortunately with the hard times we are all facing and this is an escape. And 1 can play easily with the whole family of all ages making and online family and friends group its epic. Again Thank You for this.

Could be a REALLY great game if devs werent so worried on extracting every penny they can from the playerbase. Filled to the brim with bots that the Devs do nothing to remove, speaking of which, Devs seem to have bought a LOT of fake reviews to boost popularity. If youre into farming games, go play Stardew Valley. Its cheap, devs actually try to improve the game and its a pay once, get everything deal. No microtransactions or abusive tactics.

When installing hay day, the arrows for age would not go past 4. I contacted them through email to correct my age. They are refusing to do so. You have no problems with taking my money but will not correct something thats totally your fault so I can receive ads and other incentives if I wish. If you believe I am 4 why are you taking my money? I have spoken to other players and I am not the only one this has happened to. Fix this! Its unfair!

I enjoyed this game till two days ago. I cant watch ads. I did the support help and everything the AI suggested and still can not watch ads. Its costing me rewards. The complete inability to get help from a human is extremely frustrating. Enough so that I might quit playing. I have messaged in Facebook, the AI help in the game. This was my last place to seek help before quitting.

I play intermittently but regularly delete as it is so frustrating, so now I just stop playing before it annoys me. Even balancing expansion items as you should doesnt really work any more. I am just waiting to find an alternative I enjoy as I cannot afford to spend money on a game. Those micro transactions could equal a lot of money wasted that I could spend on real life important essentials.

The game was nice and fun until now, the production time of some products and the planting time of some crops have been reduced and thus their price has been reduced, I did not like this at all and I feel like I am losing money instead of gaining money, like Lobster soup, it takes a long time to get this Lobsters but because the production time of the soup was reduced, its price was also reduced! I do not like this at all

The game was recently updated and it has given us new items such as Blueberry Muffin and Blueberry Cheesecake. Why stop there? Why not give us more Blueberry items like Pie, Candle, Juice, Smoothie and Ice cream as well? Also, some of the sticker book items come up for sale in the shop offer, which we may not necessarily want to buy, using money. Why dont we get the chance to buy it using the game coins?

Its really good a game, however if you let us collect meal more than 15 it could be better, because if i want to have more than 12 dogs it will be difficult to feed them and use it for food too.

our neighbourhood buddy has been playing over 10 years. Suddenly lost both farms. Primary farm registered in Supercell but despite reaching out via various means, the only answer she got was cannot recover her farm cos cannot prove shes the owner. Despite providing receipts for all purchases,  providing tags, ids, etc etc, hayday admin still wont help to recover her farm. Baby farm wasnt registered with supercell but managed to recover it back. Whats the point of registering with supercell?

I got this game back in 2012 and I remember the only way to get coins was by the boat, town or truck. Now they have other ways that you earn coins such as the play pass and other stuff. Its not a pay to progress game. This is my favorite farming game. I hope they continue to put new items, animals and events. Ten out of ten would recommend

Its a problem with game Hay Day. I dont have the waterfall anymore! I bought one with cards when we had to have it for the picture, you can see it in the album. Now I dont have it anymore. I wanted to rearrange it, Im going to the animal sanctuary, so I noticed that its not a waterfall. I want it back. Ive had problems before when I didnt receive a gift after the video from the offer in the right corner. I didnt get them back. Or my diamonds were disappearing. I want them all back.

The game sometimes got technical issues example when you help someone loads the boat or truck cant click it! Today I hire the boy to search the products but the products I selected suddenly disappeared then I have to out the game twice just go smoothly. Another issues is when I want to open the chest watch the video it would freeze it.

Wait forever simulator. Spend real money to play the game now, or come back later after clicking like 3 things. When I download a game I want to play it. Things dont have to be instant, but you need to give your players something to do. Look at literally any farm sim, but of course you know that. Thats why you sell the ability to keep playing for microtransaction money. Just sell the game itself at that point.

The developers are greedy as hell, they have events with tasks you cant complete because you dont have the machinery yet and the cost to buy more tasks is absolutely ridiculous, starts at 10 diamonds and goes up higher the more tasks you buy. Been playing for years and now I wouldnt recommend it unless your ready to spend a lot of money, they should only give tasks for the machinery you have.

Does anyone notice the high rating, but the low reviews? Do you this Google post honest ratings??? Game keeps crashing. Updates only make things worse. There is no customer support at all. This is a game where people spend money for stuff and no one that runs or makes this game cares if it works properly or not. Zero help Ever! It is very sad that a company thus greedy refuses to, at the very least, make sure the game works right some of the time.

I have been planting this game since decade or more. not sure. but suddenly what the hell happened to the game? it just turned yellow?! the news paper colour is worst and it hurts the eyes to the point where uninstalling seems like a best option. seeing all other negative reviews and the team not bothering to answer any I dot think you guys value your customers and players. but fix that stupid change of colour thats been since three days or so

I recently lost my old Hay Day farm, which was at level 68. Since Facebook or Gmail login is no longer supported, recovering progress has become very difficult. Please bring back Facebook or Google account login so players can easily save and restore their farms without losing years of progress.

Absolutely love this game! The only issue is recently, there has been a mass amount of bot farms selling sugar cane and it is clogging all newspaper slot so you cant buy anything. As far as I know, there is no way to report the farms.They are obviously bots because all the farm names are random letter sequences and they are all between level 712. And when you look at their farm stats, every single one has exactly 7 or 8 truck orders filled. All the farms also have the exact same layout.

This was, and still is my favorite childhood game. I grew up playing this while I was in the summer vacations at my Grandmother. Sadly, shes not with us anymore, but this game brings me joy and memories of the good old days. I cant log into the previous account, but its okay, I started fresh and its really lovely starting up from the beginning. That account held memories, but Im sure my grandmother is still watching how I grow with this new account too. Thank you for this amazing game.

I used to love Hay Day, but the game has become completely paytowin. The Farm Pass locks all the good rewards behind a paywall. This months 100 diamonds reward cant even be completed without buying the pass and extra items. No matter how much time you spend, if you dont pay, youre blocked.Its frustrating that hard work isnt enough anymore. I dont mind grinding, but now it just feels pointless.The game keeps pushing purchases instead of rewarding loyal players.I finally uninstall it

This is the first farming game Ive played, and itll be the last. Its a total time waster, which one could argue goes for all games, but I found this one absolutely ridiculous. You spend all day growing and producing stuff to either to give away for certain precious items (its all about increasing your storage capacity or territory). Lots of interactions require long waits which can be shortened by spending diamonds, which can only be purchased at the amounts needed. Its a demoralising joke!

Its not very good anymore . Too much money is needed to play this game. You hire Tom for 10 days, and during sleep time, I bet we only have him 5 days. Cant unlock the field. Too many expansions are needed. Mallets are never to be seen. there are too many tasks at once. scrolls and chick tickets, and the colour tickets are very rare. cant finish tasks without having to buy diamonds. supercell messed my age up,got me down as a young player,therefore restricted but still accepts my debit card

First played the game from Facebook, and forgot it for awhile. Then got a smartphone and tried to search the game app and its there! Plus with the data saved in the SuperCell ID, and I can play it again as how I left it few years back. The game is great for a slowpace, idle online game. My favourite part of the game is if you dont play for a few days, the farm stays as how you left it, the plants will not die and the product from the machines will not will not go bad. Not a bad deal for me.

I tried to recover my account via transaction IDs and was told it was deleted due to inactivity, so I then tried to make a new super cell id, but Im not receiving any of the verification emails.

Google Play Games beta on PC is perfect for games like this, and Im sure many players would be excited to see Hay Day available here.

its very very good game but I cant buy anything from the daily dirt that sells stuff. its field with bots that buy everything in an instant like 1 second after the refresh happens. So normal players have no shop guys... I am 30 lvl and I never brought what I want from it. Bots that hackers have take all good stuff u can only find like very worthless stuff...

Ini adalah game pertanian online terbaik yang pernah aku coba. Gamenya santai, tenang, dan tentunya seru parah untuk dimainkan. Konsep pertanian yg natural mirip banget kayak di dunia nyata tapi versi virtual. Cocok banget dimainkan ketika sedang lelah, bosan dsb. Cuman game ini sering banget lag dan bug jaringan ketika online apabila di perangkat lowend. Jadi, saya mau ada pengaturan bagi pengguna lowend seperti matikan animasi, ubah grafik (low, high), matikan efek tambahan dll.

Good game but they have made it so only my account can sell crops for half the price other players can but my stuff grows quicker (beta test). That just means I have to play alot more but get less money for playing. Someone will just buy out all my stock and sell it for the higher price and I can no longer buy crops in the store cause its double the price I can sell it for. Ill leave this review until either my account is fixed or everyone has the same price in the store. Unfair

This months fiasco with the farm pass bundles was an absolute disgrace, with both support and your social media sites shying away from advising the players or explaining anything to them, we were all left in limbo. The 15  compensation is nowhere near enough after losing 30 hours farm pass play. And I am still waiting on my extra 50 slots in both my silo and barn. Very poor show indeed!!

I love this game but its ridiculous how you cant buy items to expand the farm with coins. I have a million coins with nothing to spend them on. So I have given up on expansion and just sell building items to make more room for farm products. I guess when that gets too hard Ill quit the game entirely. These people are too greedy. I understand you want to make money but their grubbing sucks all the joy out of playing.

Recently, when playing Hay Day and using farm helpers, I noticed that my farm items decrease instead of increasing. I had enough animal feed and more than 100 units of meat, milk, wool, and eggs, but later they were reduced. I also had over 50 white sugar, which suddenly dropped to around 20, and other sugar types did not increase. Additionally, I had more than 20 cream and butter, but the next day the helpers produced almost nothing. What is the benefit

So I bought the other 2 thinking thered been a mistake, only to look at my credit card and see that all purchases went through. Meaning, I paid twice for the 2nd 2 parts. So I tried to get partial refund. Their system told me if they refund me , theyll have to kick me out of the game. I tried actually writing to them with an explanation, but never heard back.

I have enjoyed playing this game untill I reached level 34... while selling my crops on the market Ive noticed as my level has got higher my crop sale has gotten lower. for example, its 36 coins for 10 corn at level 34 but with a lower level the same crop can be sold for higher. so basically the higher you are in level the harder it is to rank up or save money for items . I cant see no logic in this strategy apart from money grabbing... shame on you!!

Also in advanced settings the find your farm option is unchecked. The pop up is getting worse, go to buy something and when I get ready to buy it that pop up blocks it and I lose the purchase.

I spend time playing Hay Day every single day because it has taught me more than patience and appreciation of the simple things in life that juxtapose the complexity of reality. It has taught me that people manifest parts of their personality and their lived experiences through every action and thought, including the way they format their farm animals and crops. Consequently everyones farm looks different and is a representation of who they are.

If you use your hard earn money Or work hard on your farm. They dont care. Theyre willing to take your money. But not. Willing to fix the issues. Ive had so many things.Disappear on my game after either. paying for it or earning it . And all they ask you is for pictures That you cant provide. So thats how they rip you off. You could have it sitting in your box for a while and then go to use it.And not be there but they just dont care. its BS

This is important for new players, this is my second time that my account and my family account have been aresed. They do some updates where they mess up your account. Doesnt matter if its linked to anything like Facebook or Google play theyll erase it even if you spend money. Its very frustrating especially when you get invested and are high lvl. I really hate the company now wouldnt recomend this game at all. They dont care about you.

I played this game 4 years ago. Gave it up because I got cheated. I believe I easily spent 1k over 2 years. Thinking about coming back to play and looking at the reviews I see that its worse. My advice is to stay away from this game. When I submitted my complaint, never heard from them so I stopped playing it and still feel guilty spending a generous amount. I know the makers are really raking in the dough and probably not from USA.

I personally am not a fan of such casual farm games. I do have to applaud the developers however for pulling out the perfect Supercell title. The many different modes (village, town, fishing, valley, etc.) keep the game fresh for longterm players which will truly make it remembered forever. Making purchases is absolutely not required for getting almost everything the game has to offer (unlike other Supercell titles).

Disappointed long time player. There are so many flaws, like certain players being able to sell goods for more than other players, valley spins disappearing, decorative items being removed from your inventory...and if you try to contact customer support you never receive a reply.

I used to love this game, and played it for years, but recently it has been exhausting me... with the new mini events which is kinda impossible to complete unless you are playing it all day leaving all of your daily life activities....

I was always looking at my friends playing this game, and I was talking to myself and said, This is a waste of time, and I was laughing at them, and i called them children but when I started playing this game i got some much fun and I learned some responsibilities
