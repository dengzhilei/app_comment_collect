I enjoy the game. The concept is fun and it should be something I can relax with. But honestly. The balance is completely off. To replay a level, it costs 900 coins, yet winning barely rewards you with 100 coins. And in the newest Ancient Adventure event, you need five wins in a row just to maybe earn a maximum of 200 coins. It just feels unfair The gameplay itself has potential, but the coin system makes progress feel more like a punishment than a reward.

This is one of the best offline games and it is very enjoyable. We hope that in a future update two new features will be added: First, the option to send messages to friends within the game. Second, the ability to purchase bombs, cannons, and missiles using money or coins. This would make the game even more exciting.

Royal Match is one of the best match3 games Ive played! The gameplay is smooth and addictive, with fun powerups and challenging levels. I love rebuilding King Roberts castle  it gives a great sense of progress. The graphics are beautiful, and there are always new events to keep things fresh. While some levels can be quite challenging, the game is fair and never forces ads on you. Highly recommended for puzzle lovers!

The game is awesome cos Im on level 9000 plus but there are lot of flaws. Firstly theyll make you win consecutively and then give you an impossible level which isnt hard or super hard level, really annoying. Secondly, Ive been competing with people who arent on my friend list on weekly contest.... and this arent normal players. And lastly, the card collection, Golden cards can at least be sent out please and chatting with old team mate should be allowed

Im loving Royal Match! Its the perfect blend of relaxation and challenge. The gameplay is super addictive  matching tiles to clear the board and progress through royalthemed levels is so satisfying . The graphics are gorgeous, and the sound effects are on point . Ive been playing for hours, and its become my goto unwind time . The boosters are helpful, and the daily rewards keep me coming back . If youre into casual puzzle games, give Royal Match a try!

Fun distraction, doesnt require money to progress, but support is ridiculously poor. Team management is a joke, you cant recruit new team members in the game, only thru social media. Other team games show if teammates are inactive; can only guess in this game. If the team leader goes inactive, the game might make another inactive player leader. I sent feedback about a new feature and support tried to delete my account! Something is very wrong with the support team, but the games kinda fun.

Loved playing but had to stop. It just became too repetitive and you need to find a good clan that has active participants. I love the graphics and you can always play and it can advance pretty quickly. I never paid for anything and was fine with the pacing. But, the game would repeatedly crash at certain times of the day, and you need to recognize when it is time to find a new clan. I totally recommend trying it.

Great game Id like to make a suggestion, can we send cards to the team instead of just individuals this would be a great way for the team to progress, like a card team bank and anyone can collect the cards, other than that love the game

After the recent updates, the game has become much more complicated and difficult than before. Events like Book of Treasures and Fan are noticeably harder and require much more effort and resources to complete. Also, the boost on hardlevel coins is lower than it used to be, which makes progression slower and frustrating. I hope you reconsider these changes and rebalance the difficulty and rewards so the game becomes enjoyable again.

I thought this game would be free and fair to play but they make it very hard to complete levels as you move on and you are compelled to buy coins, which they have a way of making sure you finish up and buy more if you want to progress. Also my game tends to not have some in game updates like the current x2 which was on a timer. Some of my friends have it on either x10 or 5 on the new update but am still stuck on the timer. I have been playing this game for 2yrs now so not sure why. Not fun

Pros: Really fun game. Many additional side games to play along with it for extra resources. No ads! Team play helps with getting extra lives. 30 minutes unlimited play daily with a challenge to win resources.  Cons: Beware designed to make you spend money! Limited lives given that replenish in time only. Difficult to get ahead or play for any decent time period without paying. Very little given to help with extended game play for the cost of buying packages.

its fun but all it is, is a money grab, because things could be cheaper so people dont feel like they are getting ripped off for large amts of RL time and game coin. Should have a All Chat, a friend chat 1 on 1, and the group chat. You should be able to text with others..... trading only 3 cards a day has not been uodatedincreased but all the costs of playing have increased a lot. Im deciding whether or not to play. Sure you dont have to buy but if you dont you play for years to advance.

Could be fun. You have to play a board 35 times before you get a winnable one. It has gotten very boring. Two years later and Im still playing this game. You do have to play most levels many times or pay for lives or tools. I just keep trying. And the side hustle games give you a few tools. You need to play five times daily to be able to collect cards to use or moves in the others. I still play it.

Fun game, great way to connect with friends and make friends with teams. After playing for quite some time now Ive found that sometimes the games algorithm sucks. Ive yet to complete a card collection for a reward. It can get stuck on levels preventing you from collecting cards or just giving you duplicates of onesyou already have. You can win ten levels to get a Super power ball but then lose it on the VERY NEXT round. Overall this game is fun, but can be VERY frustrating sometimes.

Boring trash castle building game where you rarely ever do what is shown in the add. It, and every game like it are boring trash, as are the developers for producing this trash and advertising the best part of the game as if its the norm when its actually rare. This boring trash is so simple that I wonder how anyone but a child could enjoy it. Will you people ever say to yourselves. Self, we should stop being a waste of space and a waste of air by using underhand tactics to get folks playing

Fun while it lasted. Stops being fun after certain level. It almost forces you to pay with real money to get the coins you need to finish a level. Unless you can play the same level over 50 times and hope you can finally pass it. Its also not as advertised. The King doesnt have a nightmare till after you play like 30 levels. Only good thing is theres no ads.

Once getting to Royal League, game has levels that are so monotonous to complete, designed so probability of win is extremely low. Game then is beyond boring. You would have to spend coins to win some games in Royal League. Developers are now introducing many changes that are confusing, not fun, and finished before you know it. What is the Robot match game all about? Not fun. How can players who at about 12 K level have stats such as 24 K first try wins on their profile.? Response pls.

good game, but holding out on golden cards is not cool, playing for hours ,completing many challenges, but not being able to collect golden cards or send yet you give us spares?! give us the cards we need to complete. Maybe we will enjoy playing more ..... still updates make the game worst to play and the rewards dont match the challenges, really our whole team has complains . this game has become a money making scheme, very disappointing

Awesome game! By far my favorite. I find it enjoyable to play and I love the graphics. Im hooked. Currently on level 500 plus. Zero complaints. Edit: Royal Match is still my favorite game. Im on lvl 797. I have not found this to be one of those games that you HAVE to spend money in order to progress... absolutely playable without relying on purchasing anything. Yes, some lvls will take a bit longer. I do not find this to be a deal breaker. edit: currently lvl 4241. still my favorite game

Its a great game. The only thing I dont like is when Im almost about to collect all the cards and they start a new round. Of course, I worked hard to get them cards and then you just clear them out for some new ones thats not cool at all, whatever wants a good game. Ive been playing for years. They need to give more incentives and more free stuff.

The levels are too hard. The blue levels that should be easy are usually harder then the purple levels that suppose to be the hardest. I sometimes play one level for weeks and yet I dont win no matter what, and the game doesnt give enough rewards, which mean you need to buy them with real money, and even when you do you still dont win.

its good and while its true that you can play it without wifi connection, the ads is a bit different from the actual game. in the ads, it shows that you have to think fast to save the king, but in the actual game its just the matching thing and no king to save then after you finish the level you get a star in which you use to build a castlemansion. i just wish there is an option where i can actually be pressured to think fast (like in the ads, saving the king from sharks etc.).

I placed a review in March, complaining about levels becoming ridiculously difficult and the game forcing you to spend money in order to continue play. This has not changed at all, in fact things are getting worse. Rewards are now becoming less, eg. weekly competitions used to reward with 1000 coins, now its 800. Most of my team members are complaining of exactly the same thing. I used to love this game but your greed for money has made it frustrating to play. Go back to your old ways!!!

it used to be a good game, but they ruined, by making the game ruins your games, impossible stages with less turns to beat it, and before when it was your last chance the game like knew how to attack to win, but now it just waste your game by attacking colos that doesnt do nothing, like if you explode a barrel that activate 3 fan and you need to hit 3 targets, the game send the fans to colors that you dont need, and makes you loose, and before the game used to sent the fans to the 3 winning

When a game is preprogrammed for you to lose 99 of the time, probably figuring youll buy some help (will NEVER happen with me), it ceases to be fun. My solution is to do what I just did.......I deleted it. Been playing these types of games for a few years so Im wise to some of the tricks they use but when they dont even offer opportunities to win, Im out. Plenty of other games out there. Adding to not fun are stupid side games  more stupid useless cards instead of power ups.

Its a very nice and fun game, because of its many and regular side events and Team Challenges.I hate two things about it;One is that saving the king is not as they show it on ads thats one of the reason I downloaded anyways i was like here is something different for a puzzle game only to find out that its all a lie.The second one is that the game becomes cruel once you reach Royal League its like they are forcing you to buy what they are selling.Fun turns into Frustration

started out harder than the others and not as hmm generous. like piggy kingdom I didnt have to buy anything until round 35 or so and it gave a lot of rewards but Im still playing and havent and wont purchase because it turns into a very costly pastime if youre not careful  Im sorry its not what you wanted from a review. I still think you should work out a plan with Google play and just charge a monthly subscription.

Theyve added so many new mini games, and it feels like theyve sped up all the animations. I chose Royal Match because it was a calmer match game. Theyve taken away some calmness. Now, its more visually stimulating, which can be painful for this migraine sufferer. Id love it if they slowed down the matching animations to like it was before. Id add another star if they do.

Ive been playing this game for about 2 and a half years. It started out as fun but the past few updates have progressively got harder. Reduced time to complete trainsdragons, reduced coins from each level, harder to collect cards due to them removing the chances of earning new ones, replacing lava quest with ancient adventure. Then ontop of that theyve made the algorithm so difficult that youre forced to spend real cash to get past levels. Its nothing more than a money grab. Bad move devs

Ive enjoyed playing this game for several years, however, recent changes have made it extremely difficult to finish challenges without purchasing additional coins. If you do purchase a coin pack, the following week the same pack will be 2, 3 or more times the amount. A challenge that once had 10 days to complete, was dropped to 5. Rewards have become less appealing. The game play is fun in the early stages but experienced players are penalized. The game itself is enjoyable and doesnt have ads

Turns into a pay to play game to continue to make advancements, with dicey mechanics (such as it failing to register certain achievements that will net the player rewards in the game that might otherwise spend  to get). These can serve as pressure to buy packs if not attentive to whats being counted properly in the game. Havent normally seen fit to contact cust svc about but did today  they lied to me.

I wish earning frames and badges would be reachable after playing over 2000 levels, the game still wants you to spend money to achieve anything more than just the next level. Also, I feel like my partners are robots  not real. Anytime I play dragon nest and put in alot of effort to grow all dragons it seems like the computer will start to work against me to keep me from achieving my goal.

Unbelievably RIGGED!!!!!!!!! The helicopter powerups used to target the things that you needed to clear the board. Now, it targets your other power ups that are already on the board. You can tell that they rigged the game to where you have to play the same level like 10 to 15 times or spend money.

It used to be fun, but now its all about money. After 4 years of playing its time to say bye. No more lighting rush, no double points for 30 mins, no 3 extra moves (was there for short time and then removed) and how are you supposed to do 30000 points at the last level to win the prize in 3 days? Spent money, got to Royal league, love my team, but everything is money money money  everything changed in BAD. Something that used to be fun now its not and clearly just about money. Disappointed

Severe graphic issues after system update on Honor (MagicOS). Have tried uninstalling and reinstalling but no luck. Frustrating as I played this game daily and with the graphics how they are it is impossible to play. Up until now I wouldve given the game a 5 star review as it is fun to play, with lots of side quests and bonuses you can win.

Fun for a while. I heard that one of the definitions of insanity is doing something over and over thinking you will be successful, but success never comes.b I had an awesome team and some good fun, until I really looked hard at my bank account. You HAVE TO PAY to win, or be frustrated as you take forever to win a level. Enjoy playing for a while, and as soon as you have to pay to advance, stop and walk away. The developers dont want you to win, because that is how they make money.

Used to be fun, now just frustrating... I used to really enjoy Royal Match  it was fun, rewarding, and a great way to relax. But lately, the game has taken a disappointing turn. The coin rewards have been significantly reduced  what used to be 1000 is now 500, and 500 is now just 250. The Lightning Time booster used to last an hour, now its only 30 minutes. Honestly, its becoming more frustrating than fun.

Used to love this game but with every update it gets worse. Now only 50 coins for winning a super hard level. Brought in an extremely hard level for 100 coins. Id rather delete the game than spend money on winning. Its an enjoyable game overall but not when you keep trying to force us to spend money.

Well developed game. Increasing challenges keep you interested. Fun, creative, great graphics. That being said, I find it impossible, or at least improbable, to go beyond certain levels without paying for more coins. And coins go fast if you want to keep advancing. They also made recent changes, where more difficult levels earn you less coins than before. They claim you can win every level wout boosters or spending coins. But youll be stuck at one level forever if you dont.

The save the king you see in the ads is rarely shown in the game. I was under the impression that the entire game would be played that way but it isnt. I still played it anyway because it has no ads and you can play offline. However, after the updates, the rewards are now lower in all events and challenges so youre basically doing the same amount of work for less rewards. This game used to be fun to play but Im quickly loosing interest in playing since they just want you to spend real

FINALLY A GAME WITH NO ADS!!!!!!! Only bad thing. When you fail to complete a level, it gives you the option to continue playing with a certain amount of moves, but the price is stupid. For 5 more moves, its literally 900 coins. That may not be a problem for veteran players who have been playing the game long enough to be loaded, but for newer players, it drains your bank. Its very frustrating when you can literally win in a move. Please fix it. Also, a match 3 game, not a save the king game:)

The Royal Match app is asking me to update the app, but when I click the update button I get the Item not found screen shown above. When I open the Google Play Store, there is no update available.

Fine game, good graphics, built to where you cannot succeed without spending real money. The puzzles are rigged to where you cannot accumulate the items, and new features, like changing the x2 to a set number of tries instead of a timer, are designed to take more of the fun away from the game.

Enjoyable until level 153 and then 265 when you simply have to sepnd money to progress. I uninstall it then. However up to that point it was an enjoyable game. Dont bother unless you need to spend your money.

DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!! IT WAS MAJOR FUN IN THE BEGINNING BUT NOW THE CONTROLS ARE RIGGED. THE MOVES ARE IMPOSSIBLE LIKE 20 MOVES FOR A GAME THAT TAKES AT LEAST 40 TO WIN. THESE HARD BOARDS ARE PRESENTED SOON AS YOU WIN A SUPER LIGHT BALL, IN WHICH YOU LOSE RIGHT AFTER PLAYING 9 FREAKIN GAMES TO EARN IT. THE CYCLE OF LOSING IS MORE THAN WINNING. THE PURPOSE OF THESE GAMES ARE FOR FUN AND RELAXATION. THIS GAME IS NOT EITHER! CONSTANTLY RIGGED WITH EVERY LEVEL!!!!

No ads, great game, but the more you accomplish, the more powerups it takes away. They really want you purchasing power ups, so free hours of races like lightening race are reduced from 1 hour to 30 minutes after you beat 10k levels. Also getting 1000 coins used to take beating 7 straight levels in the Lava challenge, now you only get that on weekends. The coin pursuit during the week you have 3 tiers that require a total of 22 levels to beat and youre almost garunteed to get less coins

Would rate 0 stars since last update if possible. Loved this game, spent way too much  and time playing until then. Game pieces dont fallflow into place anymore they snap into place. While making matches the power peace doesnt appear. Robbing me of the match (not every time but too often). Enough that if its not worked out I will be uninstalling the game. Even after all the moneytime Ive invested into it. Ive cleared storagecache repeatedly. Uninstalledreinstalled game nothing works

The game is fun. BUT.... The game does not play this way. In fact, the game plays nothing like this. I played the game more.but I found in the long run they charge you too much. I wish this kind of game would get a clue and stop overcharging. Maybe that the game can really succeed instead of looking for shortterm money

I downloaded this to earn points on a gift card app since Im usually good at match 3 games but...theres too much going on. When I play a match 3 game, I just want the game levels, not a ton of different pop ups for whatever events the dev team came up with. 1 or 2 is fine, but sometimes I get what feels like 10. Its too much, and it interrupts the game flow. Im only continuing to play to get my points at this rate.

Im on level 5648, the last few weeks you cant play without dumping money into the game, and even when you do you will clear the board with 1 spot to clear and it makes you start all over again. Ive been on plenty of forums that all complain about this same issue. It has been taking me over 30 tries lately to clear one level. Its obvious the propellers dont go where they are needed, if you get a powerball youll lose it right away. This game isnt fun anymore.

This game is a money maker. Get a super light ball and you will rarely get one in a game unless you bring it with you to start. The hints dont help you so dont waste your moves using them. You can only win if you spend money. The levels trap you in a corner where you spend too many moves just to get out of the stupid corner. The game used to be fun. It has turned into a money maker and is no longer fun anymore. I do not recommend it. unless you are ok with spending  to win. Removed it.

I really enjoyed the game. Every 1000 boards or so, a new type of challege is added. The problem I found is when I reached level 6000, the latest challenge is part of the board shifts every move.

enjoyed playing this at the start. now it takes days to complete a level unless you spend money (i refuse to do this). Each level should be doable without all the extras or spending. completed thousands of levels, so not because I can not play. dont bother to start playing. You will be disappointed when you realise you cant progress any further without getting your bank card out.

Greed Has Taken Over The game USED to be awesome. You rarely Save The King, I was tricked thinking thats what the game was all about. But, I ended up liking the game anyways. After spending money and time on this game, I think Im done. The rewards have been reduced and the levels are hard to achieve. You could need only one gold card to win a challenge but youll never get it. Its all luck and no skill. The games within the game is rigged. They want you to spend money.

The game is becoming a joke! the levels are becoming a lot more difficult(understandable), but the rewards for them and the different challenges that come along, are becoming less(how does that make any sense?). Also, we are tired of seeing the same setup each level we reach. it lacks creativity and ideas... it is too repetitive! This game would be perfect if we are given some different creative challenges as we advance, and are rewarded accordingly for our efforts!

keep giving the same cards instead of the new ones and not allowing players to get the points to finish the cards Why is the game being controlled? I have 117 cards of 135 ..to reach grand prize but the cards are not given the balance 20 and the competition will be over tomoro.

I had to revise my review to give it one star. Now I know why they advertised the hell out of this game when it was first launched. It starts out fun and not too challenging but as you progress it wants you to purchase items for the game. I never waste my money on games, not in this economy with people not knowing if they will be laid off the next day. You will advance only so far before you will be forced to make a purchase to continue to play. Uninstalling!

Overall its a complete ripoff. Rigged glitches to keep you from winning  forcing you to buy to pass a level. Im well over 12000 levels  have spent 3 days on some levels. Then I make a purchase and beat the level without even using anything purchased. Swipe certain combos  something entirely different happens. Forced to use my entire cache if I have too much stockpiled, then suddenly  easily win, after, everything is depleted. Save your money. Probably see a lawsuit soon.

good time waster, though it does get more difficult to beat certain levels, if you join a team you can hold 15 extra lives, and they do 30 minute unlimited lives events that can help push through some of the harder stages. def helps to keep super light ball if possible and doing events or even if you help your team it can give you extra resources to maybe beat some more levels, better than candy crush IMO

Totally pay to win only, which if it was reasonable and effective I wouldnt mind, however the only way to progress is to pay LOTS of money! Shame because it was a fun game.

There are no ads but you STILL NEED to BUY if you want to advance. When you do spend  the next week they increase cost of packs . After a few hundred levels the rewards are very diminished. NOTE: if you buy a pack that has additional time (ie: 1 hr unlimited powerups), be prepared to stay the entire 1 hr or lose that time you bought. Theres no way to pause or save time if you need to leave game. (btw this happens in other games also)

FAKE ADS. Another typical match3 game, very similar in play to Candy Crush, with a weaker design premise than Gardenscapes. No ads in the game, but RIDICULOUSLY ANNOYING ADS in EVERY OTHER game I play, which is much much worse, and of course the ads are FAKE and dont match the actual gameplay. Its a simple game but the premise and design is weak compared to similar games. The design is dumb, and the situations are even dumber. I know its a cartoon, but come on, this lacks any imagination.

What I find offensive about this game is that the designers think players are idiots. When you execute a move you get an outcome other than what should have been, all in the hopes of money grabbing. Games are made to be profitable but if a game is designed to make a player lose then it is dishonest programming.

A good game up to a point... and that point is when you hit emerald levels. They are impossible to complete with the number of moves you are given. But of course, that is by design, to encourage you to either a) spend money on more moves or b) use your resources, which will quickly deplete, and then spend money. Either way, if you want to get a special frame, or a badge etc, once you hit emerald levels, you wont get anything unless you spend. I pack in playing until the 2 week reset.

Addictive but frustrating if you do not spend money on the game. The first time you start a level, you are about 5 moves to complete the level. It will cost you 900 coins to continue the game and probably will take more than the 5 coins you just paid for. Then it cost 1800 coins for 5 more plays. If you keep starting new games it cost time.

I like the game especially without ads interrupting every level but in the end its still just a money grab. You win very few coins in gameplay  spend 900 for an extra 5 moves then 1900, 2900...ect. And again 1900 for boosts. Somewhere around level 1500 if you dont spend real cash, its almost impossible to advance. Im tired of playing the same board 20 times to advance. Maybe its time for something else.

Great levels but you have to pay if you dont have enough points to continue on so you get stuck on a level for a long time. and the ads that they show you are false because I have been playing this game for about 2 years and never once have I ever come into any one of the ones that they show on the ads. so if youre looking to play the game for those kind of ads, forget it

I love this game but I dont like having to Play levels 50 to 60 times before I can pass them. It used to be if you cleared your data and uninstalled and reinstalled you could restart from the first level but now you cant. Its too irritating to have to play the same one over and over and over!

no ads is good. about 8 hours of free to play is also good. afterwards, once you get to level 170 you either quit because you cannot progress or pay money, which is also fair. not a mind blowing idea but then what do you expect from a casual game?

NO ADS! Yup, its real, there is really no ads and because of that... this game is slowly ruining all other games lol. I now get more frustrated that other games has so many ads that I have abandoned them. The levels are the right level of difficulty that its drives me to keep tryin without feeling like Im failing over and over. I highly suggest playing this game

I used to give this game 5 stars. I have downgraded it to 3 stars because the creators have reduced the perks you get during the game, reduced the amount of money you get with hard and super hard levels and elsewhere as well. Made it harder to complete card sets twice or get to the end of the dragon and train quests. This has reduced the enjoyment substantially

Pay to win algorithm. Dev programming rigs the game against the player. Cascades and drops are inconsistent, and are usually not in the players favor (by design, I strongly suspect) in order to coerce the player to make a purchase to clear the level. Decent time waster, but know what to expect.

Meh. The propellers go after blocks that dont help you, instead of going after the most difficult obstacles. Matching a super ball with TNT only damages at one hit...make that make sense. Sometimes the power boosters are more of a hindrance. Too many stupid games in between. I shouldnt have to spend 15 minutes putting together stupid puzzles to get prizes when I have more than enough pieces to win, for example.

Do NOT join a team. This will pressure you to spend money to win challenges to keep teammates happy. Customer Service AWFUL, they do not care how much money you have spent, do not appreciate and do not care if taking days to pass a level despite having just made a 40 purchase  and yes the pressure to spend that much quite often is real in this game. DONT BOTHER. Developers posting fake 5 star reviews on 171225.

Stop! Do not waste your time or money. It is not free as they claim. Extremely glitchy gambling game, definitely has some AI built in as it does everything it can to cheat you or make you lose to buy extra lives and power ups. New edition is so much worse, the developers or owners are super greedy. It is now impossible to advance on some levels without paying to win. Program makes things you build and pay for disappear so, you will never move in to next level wo pay. Literally, they are thieves

Same frustrations as others. Once you get to higher levels it can take many, many attempts to pass the level. Have had levels numerous times where only one more item to clear and no more moves. Also the game doesnt provide the blaster even when the correct number of the same objects are connected. Great game to waste a lot of your time. I will not pay to play any game, so I guess I will be stuck on the same level for days upon days. More super hard levels than Kings nightmare or bonus levels.

challenges are an hour long, this game would be much better if it operated like how Royal Kingdom does with shorter challenges that are like 30 minutes. Royal match also has a tendency to require the use of more gold than Royal Kingdom does. It seems like the developers have really made clearing levels difficult with requiring lots of gold use these last few months. Ive steadily seen my gold stash of 150,000 whittled away down to 11,000 in a span of like 2 months. probably gonna stop playing

It has been 89 months since the game became unnecessarily difficult and stressful. I emailed the developers as well on why the prize money was reduced so drastically and why the levels were made so unnecessarily hard. Ive never spent money on games and it is not supposed to be this stressful. but Ive ended up doing both on this game with zero satisfaction of actually playing a chill game. I am disappointed to say the least on how much the developers will go to  to grab money from people.

Boring. The ads for this game show challenging situations which look like fun. But when you download and play the game the levels are both too simple and have what looks like shooter, not the strategy situations which are shown on the demo. Shoot the things until they transform into other things, then shoot them some more. No progress to the strategy part.

Great Game, but its pay to win. The rounds are set up that you eventually pay cash for bonuses or power ups to just finish rounds. I can literally spot how the algorithm allows for a few easy rounds to go in your favor and then you cant compete a round for more then 15 attempts, until somehow everything falls perfectly in place on your last move, and now you have to either fail and try again, or spend money on coins to continue... Brilliant game, with a brilliant money making algorithm.

I used Royal Match to keep me busy when I gave up smoking, it was great it didnt cost a fortune and the rewards were okay and allowed you to play without too much out of pocket. Over the past 8 or so months the game has slashed rewards, increased prices and the algorithm makes it impossible to maintain a reasonable playing balance. I am currently looking for an alternative game and would caution anyone who believes the assertion that this game is playable without expensive buy in.

Free but not free. Its free to download but from there, youre spending tons of real money just to play. They dont give you enough chances to make you spend 900, yes thats 900, in game gold to get only 3 more chances. Then you have to pay 1900 in game gold to get 3 more chances. Then 2900 and so on. It becomes ridiculously expensive and its totally NOT worth it.

Its laughable they classify some levels as hard or super hard. at some point even the easy levels are damn near impossible to beat. Its painfully obvious there is little to no play testing. What I would classify as an easier level can take days if not weeks to beat, UNLESS, youre will to spend a bunch of money buying addons. So basically, this game is just another money grub. Oh, and the only difference between, easy, hard, and super hard levels, is how many points you can earn.

A great game until you reach a certain level, when it becomes so hard that you play for 5 minutes, lose all your lives and cant play for a couple of hours until you get your lives back again. Alternatively you can purchase lives which is exactly what the developers want you to do and is why they make certain levels ridiculously hard to beat. Very annoying

Over 1000 levels in, to test comments, there is definitely a change after you buy something. Color drops make more special items more often. Then suddenly it will stop, difficulty curve will spike until you make another purchase (even if its a low amount) I have observed this through similar match games. At least you know what you are getting into.

Ive played Royal Match for 3 years, but its gone downhill fast. Rewards keep being reduced, difficulty has been ramped up and the new extremely hard levels feel designed to force spending, not reward skill. The game is now tedious and unrewarding.

Kept giving me the message that I was out of moves when I wasnt. Would let me continue to play if I paid with points. Started this on level 5, so when it did it again on levels 6  7, I uninstalled the app. Didnt get to play long enough to know if I would enjoy it.

False advertising. This app implies that a character is escaping impending doom while you, the player, solve puzzles to save or rescue them. In reality, that is not how the game plays at all. The gameplay is completely different from what is advertised. It promotes one experience but delivers something entirely else. This app is highly misleading. Do not download it based on the advertisementyou will not get what you expect.

Big suprise, the ads are lying to you. I tested this terrible game, and I hated it. While it does work without wifi, even after playing 25 levels, there are NONE of the minigames you see in the ads. None of the levels are about saving the king from rocks or spikes, it is just a basic match3 game with large font and flashy lights to make old ladies like it. Essentially, I wasted an hour of my life so you dont have to.

Full of errors lately, no possibility to report any, not much incentive to keep playing. The puzzles that are advertised are so rare and so basic, not worth it. It is basically a candy crush but more annoying and taking ages to complete a higher level. For example, spent days trying to pass a level and when I finally get the right strikes the game doesnt record the hit and have to start again. very dissapointing.

So Im on level 27 now and all Im playing are match 3 games. so far theres nothing in this game that shows what the ads for this game are about. The only thing Im playing are matching three or four items. There are a million other games like this that I can play instead of false advertisement ones like this game. Even if the game is free with no ads I expect it to be what the game ads claim them to be about.

VERY misleading. The advertised depiction that drew me in was nothing like how the actual game play goes. I was so disappointed to find that this is just the simple run of the mill 3,4 or 5 color swap match game. You have to complete many levels before you get to a VERY brief save the king type of entertaining scenario to play. I wont waste anymore time on this.

Do not download this app unless you like spending a lot of money. The app is great until you reach the higher levels then it makes it impossible to get past a level unless you buy more coins. It gives you too few moves for a level, making it impossible for you to beat it. The creators are a bit too greedy. I know thats how they make money but this is a bit much! Pass, pass, pass!

ive been playing. even beat all the levels before. but this time around the amount of coins you get as well as power up or whatever you call it does not match meaning is just too little. I feel like they know if u purchase extras and then they do not offer you winnable situations so you have to end up purchasing more. im done spending my money.

In the game, what are you doing? One guy is reaching 3k or 4k with a single x, and youre disrespecting him. Theres a player who has never even made it to the top 20, and youre giving him an extreme level  thats unfair. Youre humiliating the players and treating them unjustly.

Im so fed up with this. Every ad for this type of game shows you a dude trying to escape from danger. You install it and actually its just a matching puzzle. There is nobody to save. Just a bunch of colored blocks

Ive never seen such a worst game anywhere. The hard level feels simple, but the normal level is extremely hard. And when the moves are over, it asks 900 coins for just 5 lives  worst. This is a total waste of time.
