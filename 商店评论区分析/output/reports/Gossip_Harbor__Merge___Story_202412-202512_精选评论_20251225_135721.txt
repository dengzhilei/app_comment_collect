fun, absorbing with cutesy animation (ina good way). my only issue is with these types of games in general:  FAR to much dialogue, and  Not enough worldset building. Im very grateful for the three choices of decor, but being th creative type I wish there were 6 or so mixnmatch decor options as well as customization for the protagonists hair, eye, and skin color, hair, makeup, and clothing style, maybe a few tattoos or jewelry to choose from... maybe someday!

Free to play only if u are okay to spend month or even years to finish it,with a logging on the clock. There isnt a lot of furniture customization. U dont help the mom and the kids like showing in ads to make a bed or fix a window or a fireplace,u rebuild a restaurant. The storyline isnt a heartbreaking as shown in the ads. Other than that the game have a good design and its polished. There is a lot of events and most of them require u to spend some mony. Edit:Im looking forward to it.

Its a cool game and story line. The art style is nice and the music is relaxing. However, past day 40, I am forced to interact with a lying and cheating scumbag who does nothing but spend other peoples money (and the story lets him get away with this) and the only character who likes him is his kid. I would feel better with a different love triangle than her SHOULDBE ex husband. As a divorce experiencer, simply ew. Been dealing with him for 16 in game days (which is like 3 months irl)

Love this game! Get on Everyday! That being said, I cant express this enough! Theres a couple things the game is missing! An undo button, atleast up to 3 times. When my finger slips from the screen or somehow double presses and I click on something I didnt want to click on, I wish to undo it! Another thing that could definitely fix the game just a little! The events!!!!! Theyre so hard to finish! Im always so close and then it ends, an extra day on the events would definitely help!

this is NOT the game it is advertised as. remember the you finally get the game with the struggling mom and you help renovate the house? not this. this is your standard, run of the mill food merging game. dont get me wrong, I play it. but this is not what was advertised and I think people need to know. the same ad is also recycled for every game from this publisher. feels like false advertising to me, even if the Google play overview shows what it actually is.

Generally well built and balanced! Cute artwork, fun story, and I appreciate that you generally get a choice on what decor is added. The biggest drawback is that not all the ads can be muted, which makes them very jarring if you have other media playing. Would love to see an option to automatically mute ads, or for ads to be muted if sound is turned off in game settings!

Its a nice and addictive game because the tasks are fun, especially when you take orders to earn coins to renovate and improve the property. But the energy runs out quickly, and you have to pay if you want to play more. I hope the game creators lower the price for buying energy. Thats all. Its enjoyable.

it is designed so you have to buy everything. the energy is rarely enough to accomplish basic tasks and makes your progress really frustrating. you cant participate in challenges unless you buy energy. I feel there should be energy reward for little wins and not only the difficult ones that you need to buy energy to win energy. and the gems, LOL, you barely have those. Ill have to delete. seems youre only interested in selling energy and gems. it keeps getting more frustrating with progress

Easily the best merge game out there! its fun, really imaginative and entertaining and theres always a new event to keep you interested! There are very little ads, but i think a few more wouldnt hurt to help you out with creating some of the bigger items which can be more timeconsuming to do. i think the energy meter should increase with levels aswell as some days you log on more to collect rather than play. But its really great and 3 months on, Im still really enjoying the game!!!!

For a merge game, this app is pretty entertaining. The characters are fun, and matching items to level up gets easier once you get the hang of it all. However, so far, this is not a match game in which you match tiles to help the characters out of bad scenarios (which was what the advertisement showed). Also, when you are given the option to receive a free item by watching an ad, bare in mind that most of the time, the ad does not load properly, and you do not receive the item.

Not really like the advertisement. But is it a bad game? Nope. The gameplay is very similar to Merge Mansion. Except this one is about a mom on the verge of divorce renovating her diner. You need coins to move on to the next mission, and you earn those coins by playing merging games. So its nothing like the ad, where youre saving a shivering mother and her child from a blizzard, choosing which part of the ruined house to fix first so it wouldnt collapse. Nope, its just another merging game.

Game itself is okay! a way to spend time and the challenges are ok, as long as you dont take them seriously. I do have one problem, many of the art used in the cards collection has starting looking like AI. I heavily dislike this. If you do not have the power to get more art, just dont add it. I loved how creative the art was but now they just keep putting out too many updates with AI art. I will stop playing if I see more AI art being used.

Very fun game and I appreciate the less obstructive monetization. But unfortunately the further you progress into the game, the more energy making progress costs, until youre barely completing a single order before having to wait 3 hours to recharge! This game needs to either focus more on energy rewards during events, or balance the later game better by increasing your max energy, because currently how the game is designed heavily punishes you for making progress and slowly pushes you away

Ive been playing this game for a year now and am at level 104. Ive also made several purchases for gems and energy that I could say is at least a few hundred dollars. The game is fun, and the side events add a little more to do when youre out of energy. Having said that, Im considering deleting the app after so long. It does get pretty expensive to play because 100 energy doesnt go far the more you level up. Theres no option for watching ads either. Asking for improvement so I dont delete

Overall okay game, the graphics are good and energy is easy to come along without having to pay for it constantly. Recharge on the generators are fairly quick too. However, the overall plot to the game and all the gossip drama SUCKS. It is more infuriating than it is actually entertaining, especially the further you progress in the game. I understand now why Ive been told in the past you wont want to keep the game super long. If you completely skip the dialogue, youll probably enjoy this.

The game is very addictive and Ive been playing nonstop for a month. It doesnt force you to watch ads and the story is mysterious and keeps me guessing. However, the more you play the harder it gets to complete the tasks without paying, and there is a lot of seduction to make you want to pay. Its possible to progress without paying, but youre limited to short 5 min sessions every few hours. Its a nice free game for if you dont need to make quick progress. Probably the best merge game.

I love the game, but the customer service is horrible. You will regularly miss out on energy boxes and bonuses due to the ad not loading and customer service will not help at all. I can only assume its because youre not paying money for the game. in response to their comment Ive been providing screenshots for ad issues with the game for over a year now. nothing seems to be resolved

update: I had a free chest and as soon as I went to cluck on it, it changed to costing 10 rubies. Not sure whats going on with this game anymore. at level 81 and am deleting it. Did they stop giving out the 2 free chests a day? It really makes it harder to play and get energy. You can only play a short time and then have to wait for the energy to refill ( which takes forever). Really Thinking about uninstalling. Fun game just wish there were more options for experience and energy.

The game is a pay to win game. it takes too much energy to complete an order plus they love to order fries  and tea which is harder to get.. at least 60 coffee and 40 tea would be great same for the fries  and dive tank. we should be able to deny orders too . I never completed a mini game it is impossible, you buy the first 100 moves for 10 diamonds then it just keeps multiplying. bad game.

This should have been advertised as a paid game scam coz the way you take forever to restore the lives which I believe is intentional so we get to spend money buying them And the more you buy the higher they increase the prices hence Im saying its a scam. and what the hack do we have to update it almost every other 2 days, this is exhausting hey. Yes I enjoy it sum days but its a money making scheme scam, must always have data to play so different from ROYAL KINGDOM.......

I like it quite a bit, but to keep playing you have to spend money. There should be more options to watch videos to earn energy to play. The actual playtime you get is quite short. Nobody should have to spend that much money to play a game. Update 10222025. I chose to uninstall this game. When you first install it there is quite a bit of rewards and ads to watch to earn free energy. Once you get past this phase you will not see an ad to watch again. Its definitely a pay to play game.

I enjoy playing Gossip Harbor. The story and graphics are great, but the energy system completely ruins the experience. You only get 1 energy every 2 minutes, which makes it nearly impossible to play for more than a few minutes at a time. I constantly have to wait hours just to complete simple challenges or progress in the story. It makes it hard to stay engaged and enjoy the game for longer sessions. Id give it a higher rating if the energy refilled faster or there were more ways to earn it.

While this is a great engaging game, with different things always going on, events, merge gameplay and a great little story line, I have one complaint, which this review reflects by taking a star away. When playing, about the time you start enjoying the game and relaxing, you run out of energy. To get more you need gems which the game is stingy on, so you have to buy gems, more likely then not. The interruption and wait for more energy is waaaaaay too long. It is still a great game! Try it!

it was fun and addictive. but quickly became a pay to enjoy game. all the events and extra items were not obtainable unless you spend quite a lot. I spent a few dollars to enjoy the game trying to complete the events and missable decors but still not enough. I would suggest extending the event time and difficulty as well. some tasks were not even possible to obtain in a short time frame.

102325: after most recent game update, the amount of coins needed for Flaming Frenzy increased. This game is becoming less fun with every update. Was going to give it until day 100, but not sure Ill make it until then. 72325: Average game. I wish as you level up your energy max would also increase as in other games. I like the story EXCEPT for the deadbeat exhusband trying to win her back. Also, game play does not match the advertisement.

I love this game, its been over a year since I have started playing and I still have fun playing the game. My only request to the game developer is if you can make the wait time lesser it would much more addictive, I would not have to wait until the energy refills. Its an amazing game but the wait time kills all the fun and forces me to look for other games. The graphics and story is amazing, love the game.

the ads literally strangled me into download this game, I couldnt escape it no matter what app I was using. the game itself isnt even what the ADVERTISING WAS SHOWING OFF  Feels like I was gaslit into downloading a completely different game. game itself is okay. cute art. a little repetitive but all merge games are. edit: Quinn is sooooo freaking unlikable.

I really like this game. the only reason I didnt give 5 starts is because they do not give you the chance to watch ads for more energy, before I spent money I was able too. and now that option is gone ..and I spend way more money on this game than I should. if it had that option to watch ads and it didnt cost so much it would be 5 stars, because it really is a fun game

Its a pretty good example of a merge game that offers pretty good rewards. I think it makes me a little sad that early game vs. late game is so drastically different. used to complete bundles for 200  400 energy, and now it takes like 1k to be able to finish everything, and thats even with me paying for stuff. I cant tell if thats their way of farming me or if thats just game progression. maybe its intended to be deceptive but look nice. oh, and the progression art styles are ugly.

I purchased a game pack and before closing the game I had over 600 energy points. returned the next day to play and all my points were gone. I reached out for assistance through the app to get my points returned and I was lied to and refused to help. All I wanted was what I paid for and with the amount of money I have spent playing this I didnt think returning points should be an issue. I dont suggest playing this game its too pricey and the technician lie and will not restore what was taken.

Let me preface this by saying I really love the early levels of this game. Great system, great progression, but like all other add free games you hit the paywall HARD with this game. After only a week of playing it takes multiple full energy to fill a single order or two if youre really lucky. Events are useless as you cant complete enough orders to get far into them. I bought a few in app purchases but its now to the point where if you dont buy energy you cant play the game.

Ive spent a lot of time and money on this game. Pros  Its the best merge game on the market. Its smooth, fast responding and easy to use. It offers a variety of boosters and gifts that definitely help you along the way. It isnt too easy, nor too challenging. Cons  Some of the items are valued way too high. 200 to over 1000 diamonds is ridiculous, considering how much energy it costs to produce these items, only for duplicates to cost so much. Especially seafood.

Not at all like advertised!!!!! I have played this game for a while now. Spent plenty of money on it BUT it is nothing like it shows in the advertisement. There is no little game trying to get money to fix your house etc. To me this is false advertisement. Whats funny, I was playing another game and saw this one advertised.

Ive been playing this game for About a month now and I absolutely love it, but how the energy drains fast is annoying and youll have to wait for hours for it to refill I guess you should reduce the energy to half per merging instead of 1 and reduce the hours it takes to refill.

If youre downloading because they make it seem like its more of a puzzle game on the ads you will be VERY dissappinted. ITS A MERGE GAME ONLY. You can collect cards for completing merges  earn rewards for those cards. Ive spent a decent amount of money over the past year on this game  only collected all cards once. They do have other little ways to collect rewards but if you arent spending money you probably wont spend more than 5 minutes on the game at a time. Cute game but gets boring.

1. Energy maxed at 100 with 2 minutes for each energy to refill 2. As u progress the storyline, it will take u several HUNDREDS OF ENERGY just to finish 1 task 3. Cards album and weekly quest are impossible to finish if u are f2p player 4. Somehow, if u make a purchase, tomorrow task will be even hard to finish. 5. Mini games are not friendly towards highlevel players ( im lvl 75 ) since u need so much energy just to finish 1 task Uninstalled

You are supposed to get a higher level of return as you upgrade generators (oranges, beverages, etc). I have all of mine at level 8, and there is minimal change. I got more oranges having two trees than I did when I meegeThe shopping cart is supposed to generate bread and french fries. It disproportionately gives more bread than fries. UNLESS you need more bread than fries  THEN it starts kicking out many more fries than bread. When you need fries, it kicks out tons of bread and minimal fries.

This is genuinely such a good free game. No ads are real, and the in game ads or sales they have going on isnt obnoxious. There are fairly frequent typos, but none that are anything more than something funny to notice. Its a fun drama game, and the merging is relaxing. Im quite far into the game now though to where its pretty hard to do much because of how long it takes to merge the really large items, but maybe im not utilizing my mystery boxes the way I should be for the mines!

Bought extra energy 3 (!!!) times, for 10, 20, and 40 crystals. Got also some bonus potions for energy, since purchasing with real money. Still cannot finish funcking bagel sandwich. Be fr. Are we growing wheat? Why else would it take THAT long? They made this order timesensitive, too. No, you dont HAVE to finish it. Yet they know exactly how to design it the way that you WANT TO. My problem is not paying once in a while, but at this point i need to pay a lot to finish ONE order. Unreasonable

I initially downloaded this app as a relaxing way to wind down for my nighttime routine. I found it fun and relaxing and the graphics are really nice. However, Im finding it increasingly difficult to complete even one order on 100. So, silly me I fall for their offers. Even after their offers with diamonds I STLL cant complete the dog order. Its been over a week. And after what? 3 or 4 clicks the dogs refil for 20 years? Same with the lemons. Its a chore. Not a relaxing game.

Best game ever. Im so addicted to the game and the Gossip in the neighborhood is Tea . But the problem with game is the amount of energy weve been given which is too small and the task to complete requires a lot of energy. If you can add the energy to 250300 it will good or you can decide and add the energy to people who succeed in reaching some levels in the game, like level 100. And please add the booster to 8. Thanks for creating such an entertaining game.

heres some advice. you should have an option of watching ads to collect more energy. you use so much and people waste their money if they want more and not have to stop playing and wait. instead of also using your diamonds which you run out fast with as well. so just have the option to watch ads to get more.

I like this game, it is fun to play and clear challenges. Yes you would need to wait for hours to renew your energy but there are challenges for you to win the energy as well and for me thats what makes it fun lol. Only issue I have is their customer support. I reported a glitch along with screenshot and they are adamant to see the issue and denied any abnormality everytime I tried to prove the defect. Clearly their customer support needs customer experience training.

I would suggest to never spend money on this game. Their customer service is useless and doesnt care to correct things. They make your card pack disappear and dont add an alert when the season ends and when you message them about it they say too bad you should have remembered the alert from 40 days before. They could easily put a reminder in the game at season end if they actually cared.

This is a great fun game. There are no ads, graphics are bold and you dont have to wait long to get coins and stars to play other scenes. Ive played for a while now and see that some items are hard to get to the next level because they only come out sporadically and some give you about 4 to 6 items and then recharges slowly. Also the conversations are expensive and it isnt easy to get coins so you can play. I had to uninstall because it took too long to be able to play again.

Update: they fixed so many of my former complaints! the game is great to play again. I can almost finish events, there are so many opportunities to earn gems and energy refills, and theres nothing invasive about this app. it truly is a great experience. it has the perfect amount of stuff going on to be exciting to play, purchases are actually great value, and the story and drama is pretty fun lol. great job to your team, you genuinely made the game enjoyable!

The game is more fun initially. It becomes boring the more you play. At first I was okay with the amount of energy earned, but the longer you play, of course, the more energy you need to get items you need to merge stuff. Its becoming annoying now because the amount of energy needed to get 1 higherlevel item is ridiculous. I had over 200 energy points,  I would guess Ill need at least another 200250 to get this 1 coffee item for a character who wants 2 items. Its making the game less fun.

The story line is good, Quinn overthinks a lot tho, so that could annoy a lot of ppl (and picks lots of fights with friends). She also isnt homeless. The game is fun to waste time, however, dont expect to complete the weekly events unless you want to fork up lots of money. I NEVER put money into games, but catch myself putting around 10 dollars a week thinking Ill be able to finish the event. Never have. Gave up. Might be a free game, but theyll get you with great deals. Not worth it IMO.

At first, I was loving this game, but now, at times, Im starting to wonder why Im still playing it... Nearly a year of playing  the storyline with the Gnomes seems neverending. But the big thing that bothers me is that the events (weekly goals, card collection, special event games, etc.) are just about IMPOSSIBLE to win, EVEN WITH SPENDING REAL MONEY! The regular merge orders are getting annoying  boring with the frequent toppedout merged items that take FOREVER even with using gems for

The depiction of a single mother completely irresponsible in caring for her own child and having the option to Abandon or Adopt another child found in a dumpster in the middle of Winter is disturbing. These advertisements are sick and these developers need a psychiatric evaluation for their mental health. Todd Kuhns should get less roles based on these advertisements alone..

Fun at first with nice visuals and a relaxing merge loop. The problem shows up after a couple of weeks: the energy system becomes very restrictive. You play for a few minutes, then wait for hours. Even doing dailies and events doesnt really fix that. Compared to games like Township, where theres always something to do, this eventually feels more like waiting than playing. Good base, but the energy balance hurts longterm enjoyment for free players.

My honest opinion? Its a fun little game. Now, my complaint is not about the energy recharge, or anything, its more about the generator pieces that take AGES to obtain. other games of the same type and developer (like Seaside Escape, for example) reward you with pieces so much faster. Wish there was a way to obtain at a higher rate. Tired of seeing useless pieces on my board that I cant even store because Id rather use my gems for other things and not opening up more storage.

pretty great game. HOW EVER... The energy is un reliable..i wish that as you level up in the game, your energy max would go up by 2030 points so that way you can continue to progress in the game. as you go further, you loose your ads to refuel your enery, and you have to wait a whole irl day just to complete one order. its a simple fix the devs could do. very frustrated, but i still like the game.

Okay, I actually really like this game. Ive taken a slow burn approach, and havent had to drop any of my real money to play it. I enjoy creating the orders, even if it takes a little while, theres always something else to do and once my energy and coins run out, I just either come back later or wait till the next day. Honestly, the only thing that bothers me about it (ergo the four stars, and not five) is the storyline. Honestly people, how many times can one gaslight Quinn? Just help her.

Do not spend money in the game. I think the game is fantastic... been playing it for a couple of years, and the storyline, side quests, characters, and graphics are great. Recently, however, I spent money for the first time. Big mistake. The energy box you could get by watching an ad now permanently costs 10 gems; and what you get inside is just blues and purples. You only get one lot of 15 energy with an ad. You only get one item free from an ad. Very poor way to treat your customers.

The game is fun to play but you need to increase the energy fill up to 300 or thereabout coz holding on for energy refill makes one stagnant for long. Moreover, the cards dont get filled up before the days lapsed. The number of oranges that comes with timing is not much. kindly increase that as well to boost the play then the set time for receiving an energy refill is long. it needs to be reduced to 30 seconds or 45 seconds.

The game is very addictive and the story in it does pull you in. I didnt even mind spending a little money to do things to advance through the game. However, that part is getting ridiculous. Upper levels dont recharge enough energy to do much of anything. My suggestion is to either severely lower prices on everything that money is needed for or start giving a lot more for the money people are spending. It is currently nowhere near enough bang for a buck.

4 stars only due to the fake ads I keep seeing for the game while Im using other apps. They present gameplay as having to match three items in order to save Quinn and Olivia (the mom and daughter) by rebuilding a ramshackle house. While the game does feature rebuilding its not in the same context, and its a merge game to fulfill orders not a match 3. With how engaging the actual gameplay and story is I dont see why these deceptive ads are necessary. Lose the lies and Id make it a 5.

As already was written in some reviews, its playable only few first weeks. More you play  less you can do without spending hundreds of dollars. I bought few times in the game for, but its dust, you should spend 50 to get something, that you really helps. And pay to play  weird slogan, its ok, if you spend few dollars or few dozen for subscription, for example, but it isnt such important or amazing thing to spend hundreds. And one more thing  support of the game count you as stupid.

I love this game and the story, but it takes way too long to regenerate energyrevive producers. Ive been playing on and off for two weeks bc the regeneration is so long, and I STILL dont have Sams dog! and this orange tree is killing my ability to complete orders. so many orders require items from the orange tree, but its very low probability to get enough parts to get 2, so you have to either spend moneygems (money) or check in every hour. if it wasnt such slow progress, 55

The rating I gave the game belies how fun it is. Game is fun but to the point where its almost addictive and that is where I have an issue. When you first start, its super fun and you make lots of progress so you want to play more but you VERY soon run into a wall where you basically stop making any meaningful progress in the game unless you spend a TONNE of money. Its easy to see the game was actually designed to get as much money out of you as possible. Not free to play friendly at all.

too much spoilt advertisment that cannot be closed and the game time too short, u wont be able to achieve anything within the game without spending gems which translates to real life money. the advertisement link always broken, no option to close or mute n will force u to install the advertisement apps if u couldnt click properly on the X button to close the ads, which tricks the user. the games merging system level becomes exponentially bigger as your items upgraded. need to spend gems.

Without making ingame purchases it doesnt play great. When I started I thought this game was awesome, after a while the free stuff they give you so you can purchase energy and can actualy play the game, goes away. I started purchasing so much stuff just to get the same feeling. After a while I started to feel that this game was a monthly financial drain and I stoped. I have played for a month now with no purchases... it is slow and time draining game with good graphics.

Your ads are everywhere and I absolutely hate them! Whenever I come across them, I immediately exit out of whatever Im doing because theyre absolutely annoying. They are long and loud without the option to mute them or skip past it. I will NEVER play this game. If one day I come across someone playing this, I will beg or bribe them to stop and uninstall it. Whoever made your ads should be forced to listen to them with high volume over and over until they understand what theyve done.

Terrible game. The first game is kind of fun, you combine 2 flour thingies to get dough, the 2 dough to get a loaf etc... but then you realize that you need probably 128 flour thingies to make a single sandwich. And after playing 10 minutes you realize that youre out of stars, and thats where they start trying to sell you stuff. Super cute cartoon but this game is completely devoid of any interest. You just keep clicking on the same thing over and over.

I do love that theres no ad popups, however.. when watching an ad to get an item (like the energy chest in the shop) you might not get it depending on the ad that plays due to it taking you to the app store and it considers you closing the game. other than that, I love playing this game but wish there were ways to increase energy level, like once you reach a certain level your energy increases a bit too.

i like this version preferrably. altho, the costs of reaching the goal items to filll the orders are too high. theres no fun or such a thing as relaxing, when you lose gameplay and have to come back later to have the life or energy refilled. its frustrating. I mean the one top item may end up costing your whole bank, coins, whatever the term in any game. it really seems easier to omit the hassle.

Its Alright  Its not that game as the ad with the used car salesman states, its a normal basic merge and renovate game. Once youre up in levels, you cant finish an order without spending money because there isnt enough energy in one day to fill it as they are multiple orders requiring very high level merged ingredients. So if you want to participate in the competitions and get anywhere or collect the prizes, you have to spend money. typical cash grab engineering.

They often have new challenges to accomplish and they give opportunities to earn gems and energy for free. Just hope its not a play forever kind of game and actually has an ending to the story. Also I havent been able to make purchases for about 6 months now maybe more and Im still able to almost complete missions. You just have to not be anal about getting all the items to the end.

I will say the game look and feel is great. The storyline will draw you in, its intriguing and fun! However, its absolutely nothing like the advertisements (of course ) and if you want to gain any progress... good luck. You basically have to dump a lot of money into it to get anywhere, so its almost not worth my time. I end up leaving the game after 510 minutes because I have nothing left to do that isnt behind a paywall. I wouldve preferred the game in the ad though.

However, once you start playing, it does become fun to play and you want to try to make as many orders and fulfill the game as much as possible. I did end up loving the game to a certain extent.

It is a pay to play not to win. If you have an autistic kid who wants to help the little girl, try to dissuade them from playing this game. The long charging times, the inappropriate storyline, and the fact that the little girl is not in the main plot cause a lot of agitation in neurodivergent children. Orders demand a lot, and even after update the producers deliver little in the required geometric progression to merge.

Nothing like the ads. I downloaded the game hoping to stop the incessant ads (a woman and child shivering in the snow or in a broken down house). I played for a few days. The story is inane but you have to progress the story to gain levels. The merge part is fun, but they obviously try to get you to spend money on energy to play longer. Most games that I play, I send a bit of money their way but this one was a big nope. Waste of time unless you want a few mindless dopamine hits.

It is a fair game if you are not in a hurry. Intriguing storyline. It just takes a very long time to upgrade the product generators. Further, does the demand for highgrade products come too quickly in the game with lowgrade generators. Then there is the demand for tea and fries, but the teabags and potatoes given are very few and far in between. But, with a bit of correction and ajustments here and there, the game can be great fun.

I find it amusing the new ads from the President of Gossip harbor has a voice over ( and not a good oe) whenever he says the name if the game. That would explain why all the similar games are SO similar and NONE of them have ONLY challenges of saving Emma and her 1or 2 kids. I down loaded matching story a while ago expecting the ads not to be living to me. at the start, you get some of them, nut as time goes on, you get less and less. I no longer even get any reference to fixing the hous

This game is extremely greedy and programed to manipulate you. The more money you spend, the more it makes you spend. Spend to support them? Nothing free again. Forget about completing challenges without paying for it. Rewards for high level orders get lower. Missing a couple of high level cards? Thatll be 13. No fries or tea? Every order needs it. A lot of a them? A bunch of orders worth nothing to clean you out. I could go on forever. Scam.

What I expected: fun at first, then a tedious grind fest. I dont care anything about the story, so I just skipped that. Everything is fine for a while because matching is easy to fill orders. But it doesnt take long before you are finding yourself burning through energy for very little advancement, repeatedly combining low level materials in a long grind. Theres no way Im spending money on a game like this, but that appears to be the only way to make actual progress, so Im uninstalling.

ive been playing this game for a while now. probably the most ive played any mobile game. It is fine at first. but once you get to level 100ish, its starts to crawl. no events can be completed because it takes so long to finish any orders. taking over 400 energy for a single order in some cases amd you only get 100 every few hours. the only way around this is to pay for more energy. Its sad the game is no longer entertaining me because of this. no progression makes me not want to play

after so many people giving 1 or 2 stars there is no proper response on issues regarding the game. people are enjoying the game and are willing to play but we dont have energy in the game to keep on playing for a longer time the daily special blue energy chest which we got everyday after watching ads is also not available now after so many emails also there is no response from you guys I dont think it is impossible to give some ways to gain energy.. except for keep on buying with money

I downloaded this game just to tell you that I hate your ing ads. They are obnoxious and ruin any game I actually want to play because you cant mute them and they NEVER GO AWAY! Even if I watch one there is no button to close it unless I pretend Im going to download the app. I feel like Im being bullied every time one pops up. So congratulations, you made it so I never play any of your BS copypaste games. To developers response: Thanks, I wish you misery.

This game is addicting but expensive! the storyline and characters are great! the merging is fun and addictive BUT you cant play for long before you are out of energy and you have to pay money if you want to continue. And this game doesnt seem to accept play points or be on the Google play pass so you cant get any break from spending money if you want to continue playing. I love the game but hate how limited it is without spending 1520 bucks a day on it.

Stingy with the energy When buying with gems, you should be able to get more than 100 energy at a time. The cost of energy doubles each time  first 10 gems for 100 energy, then it doubles for the same amount. Why? Energy should refill after finishing a level, not just give a small 40energy box. I get that the goal is to encourage spending, but it feels too limiting, especially with so many levels to create on the items, some have up to 15.

The greed is strong with this one, at every single opportunity the game tries to sell you something and to add insult to injury one can only watch ads twice per day to accumulate energy. Update: Greed got stronger, now whatever little energy boost you can get errors out(especially those god forsaken playstore rerouting ads errors out every single time) and all you get is 10energy instead of energy chest which you can only get once a day.

FALSE ADVERTISING. VERY disappointed. lured in by ads where you help a mom and child, but this is just a merge game. have not had any instances that resemble the ads. just merging and rebuilding a cafe. I really just wanted to play a game where I help the woman freezing in the snow but there was zero of that. theyd get a better rating if they just advertised what this game really was. the ads are very misleading, even though they claim otherwise. This company should go make that game. Id play.

CAUTIONTHIS GAME IS A GAMBLE 1. you are not helping a mother and child living on the streets. youre rebuilding a business. 2. you are only given 100 moves but items needed to progress through the game require more than 100 moves to create. 3. ALL purchases are time limited  if you do not complete the tasks in the time given, you lose what you paid for and because you need more than 100 moves, you are guaranteed to lose unless you buy more moves. you only get 1 move restored every 2 minutes.

While the matching is fun, there are a lot of better games than this dev makes. The game is 100 Pay to Win and while you dont need money to play, everything you need to progress is locked behind chests that never drop, locked by a pay wall, or is gifted exclusively to Hackers who cheat in the PvP Events to get First Place every time you close the Event Page.

Simple gameplay loop that is fun and addictive, and compelling story. However, events have a short time limit that often cannot be cleared even if you play across entire off days, and even if you spend money to advance more quickly. Its not a huge amount, but it still feels like players are not set up for success even if they do pay when time is your main opponent. Better luck next time feels disrespectful to the players time and effort. Long story short, try it out but dont put money in.

Well, for one thing, the new ad campaign is a bunch of lies. none of the things that happen like the snowy house or the broken stuff?None of that stuff happens. what it actuality is? its a match game that pretty much it.. I played for months and still know basically nothing about the bitter gnomes. its a decent match game, but mostly it tries to tempt you to pay money. it requires a run of money to finish any of the events, but you still get good stuff, just dont expect to finish events.

The game is ok. Its a basic merge game, doesnt match thr ads you see, but its fun enough. My issue is that any currency earned is required to progress the story and naturally you dont level up if you dont progress the story. I dont like that any money I earn through matches has to go to paying for the next part of the story, I also dont like the main character. shes a weak female type with poor boundaries. Its frustrating to watch.

Theres always promotions and like side games you can play and while waiting for energy can be frustrating its fair enough in my opinion.

Ive played games for the period Ive been on earth but I am super addicted to this game. I love all characters,even the baddest of them all,and it keeps me curious about what is to happen next. It has few ads and the time frame for a Bubble to come up is really low,so it gives me time to merge with fun until I get tired. Team Quinn Am challenged by the fact tht it takes 2 whole minutes to generate one energy yet I have more orders to give out,of which the energies wasted are too for one order

Downloaded game is completely different than the ad. Ive played for 4 hours straight. its just a merging game. not the game where you rebuild things and rescue the mother and babies. if you just want a merging game with a story, you would like this.

Updated. After a long break I reinstalled.There are still in app purchases but it appears they arent as bad as they were before. I dont feel like I am stuck in the story for days at a time unless I opt to pay for gems etc. I dont mind paying for in app items but after a certain point it would really be wonderful if it unlocked the full game and removed all purchase options after you have paid a certain amount or something. Perhaps offering only rare and exclusive items after? Just an idea.

The energy cap needs to scale with player level. I just spend 100 energy without even getting my full item. Now, I have to wait 200 minutes to gain all that energy back. Increasing the energy cap as players progress would make the game feel far less punishing and more respectful of players time.

Game is good. Dont believe these ads they are in no way how this game is, unless these are late stage game levels(which I doubt). Orders are easy at first, timed events are fair, then you get to where I am and it takes hundreds of energies to get part of 1 order done(looking at you shellfish net and storage bin). Dont get me started on having to click through events that I dont want to participate in(looking at you racing events. The flower event is garbage as well).

I hesitated for a long time about downloading this game honestly because the ads are annoying followed by all of the negative reviews. I finally decided to give it a try. Merge game with a storyline (that I mostly skim) to rebuild restaurant, etc. You do run out of energy kind of quickly if you dont buy more, but I just stop playing for a couple of hours and then come back later. Ive gotten quite a few freebies for completing orders so I think its a relatively relaxing timewaster.

At the start, good. But very quickly progressing all but grinds to a halt. You need thousands of bolts to just get 1 item. if you want to be competitive with other players and achieve goals, you have to buy, buy, buy, that is a ripoff, because its obvious to me. its designed to be this way. At level 92, its impossible to play and compete without buying. Theres no point playing anymore. Had enough, which is why I give this app 2 stars.

The ad is a LIE. Nothing like described, yet its just like all the other games like this. Its not exactly fun, but weirdly addictive. You run out of energy too fast, takes too much energy to fulfill orders. Recharging for the dogs keeps getting longer also taking forever to get to that goal. Too hard to achieve the time based games or anything unless you pay. Contemplating deleting as the frustration is outwaying the enjoyment. Same complaints by others, but nothing is done to make it better.

Great game... up until you get far enough where you must pay to play or be very, very, very patient to move ahead. The items become more advanced, the renovations cost more, the number of guests with likes is fewer thus rewards are fewer, the opportunity for jewels or tap charges diminish. Thus, unless you want to spend money, you wait alllll day for a peach tree and a dog house to recharge and 100 minutes for 100 charges to use them only to wait, wait, and wait.

Its a fine game when filling up idle time but there are certain features that can make one crazy. 1. when trying to open the game, way too many events, daily and side quest announcements pop up. Meaning you have to push x soooo many times before starting to play the game. 2. the energy vs. goal usage is very uneven, the further in you go into the game 3. the game has made many free daily gifts that you can get via watching ads, into needing to pay for them with gems. Which is very annoying

I give this a four star because now it wont let me claim the energy chest anymore unless I use gems. Normally Id watch an ad to unlock it, which Im fine with since the game doesnt have interrupting ads or annoying ones. But now, I feel like its not working anymore. I still love this game, overall . The chest keeps saying 1 left, and I cannot watch an ad to get it. I would rather save my gems for 100 energy, because sometimes the energy chest doesnt give you a hundred energy.

I love this game but its virtually impossible to play without spending money and the longer Ive been playing the harder it is to complete events and the more you are pushed to spend. The mini games start off with high rewards but as they get towards the end of the time the playing pieces suddenly become really hard to come by and the mini game is impossible to complete without paying out (and even then its not anywhere near gaurenteed).

Like several other people have started in their reviews, its fun at first and becomes a pay to win. with energy provided you might get an order completed but take several days to complete a more advanced order with the energy provided, which in turn makes the game less fun. But since the update I just did yesterday, I have not been able to play at all. it starts downloading resources then goes to a black page with hello in the top left. So I will be deleting this instead. I was over level 100..

I cant believe it, but I havent had to make a purchase yet! I finally found a game you can progress through without making a single purchase. Other merge games eventually trap you by making it impossible to reach the next level without making a purchase of their in game currency, but Ive been playing Gossip Harbor for weeks now and havent had to make a purchase yet! Its awesome! Also, I love the mystery element woven into the story line and redecorating the house.

Addicting and money grabbing. Matching is great, but the story can be cringey and you can tell its gonna be a long game. There are also so many side quests that they make you wanna do and they offer little 1.99 specials to complete it. I sunk about 12 into it before I woke up and uninstalled the game. Fun, but if youre not good at saving money, dont play this game. I would recommend Wordscapes instead. You can play without having to pay real money.

Im addicted to this game but it can be very expensive for you to keep playing the game and not end up bored of waiting if you dont spend any money on the game its almost impossible to win any of the events, which again makes the game boring not sure if you can complete this game but I feel like there should be a goal to reach so if you do end up spending money then at least it would feel rewarding also an idea to maybe adding a teams system that you join where you can ask for lives off others

I love this game! except for the fact you CONSTANTLY are forced to STOP playing it unless you decide to spend money. If there were ads available in order to continue playing all the time, I would. but they dont even give you that option! you run out of energy and you have to wait for more. the energy recharges 1 every 2 minutes. thats insane. I am always forced to exit the app and wait like 3 hours just to be able to play with 100 energy (it maxes out at 100 when recharging)for only 5 mins!

addictive, but my problem is that what was advertised never came up, even im lvl 94 or so, they mentioned in the ad that the advertised content would later appeared, and it never did. liars. also, i could watch ads to get some extra things, now in a 100 unavailable, and only paying options are available. challenges are extremely hard, so unless you are constantly opening your phone or putting a lot of money, you cant complete them. RNG is also a huge problem, youd 100 energy on to get potato

I went into it knowing about micro transactions but God this game is so obnoxious with them. I buy the monthly pass but outside of that, the rest of the ads have had me wanting to uninstall and forget this game exists. The devs should be ashamed of themselves. The money hungry nature of the game betrays a decent, casual experience with an honestly idiotic plot and I hate the little kid.

This game is fun but has 0 sense of accomplishment. They make it impossible to play longer than 10 minutes at a time, without spending real money. you dont get enough energy to complete any missions. it takes way too long to complete certain orders. Ex: if Im trying to complete 1 with a new ingredient, I use up my energy in 5 minutes and Im not even halfway through completing an order. I have to wait about 4 hours to do more. Needs to be easier. you cant use your own words to give feedback

I truly love this game. However, once you spend money a few times..(which in order to level up you have to.) They increase the amounts. For the same thing they offered pretty cheap in the beginning. The energy is expensive once you add it up. I am about to delete the game because of the greed. How are you going to have a Christmas theme right now and increase your prices 15.00 for barely anything. No thank you. Not anymore. I have kids and this game isnt worth that much money  that sucks!

Can you people reduce the way you sell your items in this game? The prices are always too high and were only playing it for fun not like were earning little things from it. Its really a turn off. Also using up to 400 energy and sometimes more to merge one order sucks. YOU PEOPLE SHOULD DO BETTER, people are not plucking money from trees.

its a good time waster. variety of rotating challenges and subgames, some better than others. the embedded story plot is fun and keeps me interested but needs more drama and intrigue, and more frequent resolution. in the matching kitchen section two level 7 orange trees yield far more oranges than a merged level 8 tree. that seems odd.

Manipulative cash grab. Support is willing to gaslight the player base over updates and changes to well known mechanics. Edit: Their response is a great example of the gaslighting in effect. I was a happily paid user before certain reliable mechanics for progression were changed without notice, at which point I was told by support that the very clear and long standing mechanic was always random with no trigger conditions. Genuinely, play anything else.

Ads: This game has no ads, the games description: Contains ads and InGame Purchases. After playing: Gossip Harbor? More like Clickbait Harbor. Dont play it if you were enticed by the ads showing thousands of animations where you help the ohsosick and poor woman and her child. This game, of course, shows a woman fixing a RESTAURANT with her daughter, but its nothing like on the ads. Checked the game so you dont have to. 2 stars because I havent been bombarded with ads.

I sincerely appreciate the creativity and effort you put into this game, and I respect your decision to include diversity in your storyline. My humble request is to consider adding a clear content notice or optional romance visibility settings, especially because some regions and families hold conservative cultural views and may not be prepared for certain diverse themes. This would allow players and parents to make informed choices while still honouring your artistic freedom and inclusivity.

Dont waste your time on this game. It looks fun at the begging and then you have to spend lots of money to get anywhere in the game. It is definitely a pay to play game!!!! Energy takes a long time to regenerate!!! You wait about 3 hours to play a few minutes!!! 100 energy is not enough! You need like 1000 energy to merge items at a higher level. You have to spend money!!! Also side challenges require spending money to complete. Lets face the truth! Waste of money for nothing

Actually good, compared to the usual games you see here. Different than the ad, but honestly a good story, good game, and NO ads whatsoever  unless you want to get rewards  even though there are issues with the rewards. However, something REALLY bothers me. It gets really draining to have so many pop ups trying to make you buy stuff every time you open the game. Theyre really trying to force it on you and I hate this. I also hate the fact theres no chance to finish the events unless you pay.

This game used to be fun, until developers ruined it. It was fun to strategize how to maximize your resources to complete really high level orders with the ice cube. Theyve now changed that and it takes several days to complete one order. All of this is out of greed, but Im not going to give them money so Im deleting the game. I dont recommend this game or anything by Microfun. Editing to add: I started by reaching out to support ingame. They lied and said nothing had changed.

RNG is suck . The higher the level, the more boring this game becomes. Play for 3 minutes, then theres nothing else to play. WHERES THE FUN IN THAT? Why pay if its just manipulated by RNG? If we dont need item X, it will appear more often, and vice versa. Other games give more fun the higher the level, but this one does the opposite . Absolutely ridiculous.

The game is NOT like the ads. It is a merge game. there are no fun puzzles or multiple levels. You can level up but it just means adding a new item to merge on your merge board. It takes a ton of energy to fill one single order on the merge board meaning you merge a bunch of irrelevant stuff, then run out of energy before you get the item you need. I thought there would be puzzles like the ads show since the ads claim the game is exactly like the ads but NO. Thumbs down!!!

Another 0, just like Seaside Escapes, for Microfun games. The algorithms are set to keep players from getting important pieces unless you spend. Full energy wasted numerous times while attempting to get needed pieces for event progression, in vain. Algorithms always insure players get shafted, so they have to spend cash. Even after spending money earlier in the game. Uninstalling and reporting. The greed and lowlife thieving tactics epitomize whats wrong with society and why its decaying.

However, you could do alot more optional ads (And not just a measly 15 energy per ad!) i only get offered ads for 15 energy twice a day. also the energy recharge is a joke cuz its 2 hrs for 100 energy to build up. Its almost like you have intentionally made this game so frustrating so that you have to spend money! Also the bubble items should be ads as well!

The game is interesting though but, I will give it 2 stars because, updates and downloading of resources consumes too much data bundle. You deduct 89 data mb to update the app, now youre charging 386.9mb just to download resources. You must know this is not an earning app and you cant even play the game without a data bundle. Do something about it or I will never play or recommend it to anyone.

I agree with the other 1star ratings. The game is fun, cute, and has an interesting story line. But, the game play truly is Mini. You get energy to spend on each match you make and you can only accumulate 100 energy when youre offline. This goes against every game Ive ever played. The matches get more and more difficult where the fun completely disappears and its frustrating to play 3min for 100 energy and then wait hours for energy to rebuild. Not a good game for longevity playing.

I gave the game a shot for a little over a month and honestly, starting off, the game is pretty fun but as you put more time into it, it slows down drastically, which is why I give it Two stars only. The limited time events are designed poorly and you have to spend quite a sum of money if you want to get halfway through some of them. Not to mention how most events make you compete with high spenders for the rewards you would want to get. Overall the game is fun at the start but gets SUPER boring

I love the story lines and the mini games. A couple of months ago I would have rated this as a 5. HOWEVER, as much as I hate to, Im going to have to delete the app. Its to the point where it takes several hundred energies to fulfill just 1 order. Rarely can I play any of the mini games because they are over before I can fulfill enough orders to play. I really wish they would lower the energies so I could continue.

Nothing like in the advert. Too slow energy recovery. Complete the order is barely possible because products appear randomly on the field. and each step cost 1 energy point. You have 100 each 3.5 hours for free. To make a tea you have to spend about 200 energy just because the tea pack appears only after 12 coffee and you need about 16 packs to get that one tea in the customers order.

The game was fun but I felt that the game had changed. Not gonna lie that I got hooked by the game and have been playing for quite a long time (Ive reached lv110 and have paid quite a sum) but the game became frustrating that full power couldnt get you an order completes. The time for regeneration takes incredibly long which at first, It was still manageable.

The gameplay and storyline are decent, and I do enjoy the game for relaxing, but its definitely a pay to win game, even moreso now. The game used to allow you to watch an ad to get small items for free or to get a little free energy, but all ad based rewards are gone now. So, you can wait a minute and a half for a single energy to generate, or you can pay for more energy. The energy you can buy has no cap, but earned energy caps at 100.

its becoming too difficult to complete orders. it can take you forever to make dino floaties( probably need about 400 or more energy, and thats just 1 stuff) and so many other stuff and even spending cash doesnt do enough to help and so cant even play the mini games. had to call it quits

this game is very addictive. I wish you got credit for the individual merges when using the multipliers (x2, x4, x8). you only get credit for 1 merge instead of how many merges youd get if you did x1. it keeps you from getting the merge reward so you can finish the seasons.

Ive been playing for about 8 months and used to enjoy the game but devs keep revising and eliminating ways to achieve orders. which is the whole point in playing. it takes SO MUCH energy (and days) to complete a single order, that you miss out on the rewards or the simple satisfaction. Its just a money grab game now. Game play is about 2 mins, which makes it feel like a chore. So Im deleting. I have a different merge game that is actually enjoyable.

Its a pretty fun game, I just never get anything that I need to make merges. Like, Ill need tea bags, which you get from the coffee, but I will never seem to get teabags, only coffee, so I always end up failing missions because I cant get what I need before lossing energy.

Too many items, not enough energy. I am at level 85. Spent hundreds on this game for sure. Never once have I received an ad to get any bonuses. The higher the level the higher the difficulty of items in orders that you have to merge. I find it difficult not to spend money for energy. You guys could do better on deals ffs... its a mobile game. I never completed an album. its hard to get 5 star cards to complete. Im about to uninstall.

Its a fun merge game, but of course its paytoplay much of the time. Theres enough freebies for a casual user to have fun, but its got an asinine tendency to not give you the type of item you want, so you have to use up all your energy tapping the generator over and over, getting stuff you dont need!

Total false advertising. The story is not the same as advertised, and yea maybe you dont have to purchase the game, but its made where you would want to spend real money unless you wanna wait for things to unlock or energy to go back up. Dont give these sleaze balls any of your money. Also the story is retarded. Toxic characters. The dumb strong independent women trope who wont let her baby daddy see her kid. Also gay guys and they thems.I get you need the story to last, but its drawn out.

Honestly a great game. It gets addicting. No adds whatsoever. Really fun and the story is kinda interesting. The game is nothing like the ad where the mother and child are homeless. In this game the mothers restaurant got destroyed and now youre rebuilding it, the husband has a mysterygoing on, youre trying to solve it, etc.. It is also sort of hard to get charge points to match in the matching game.

Overall, its a really cool game to play when Im bored, but but after a while it got really slow and takes up way too much energy. And it takes a very, very long time to make big Orders, I wish that they had some sort of mini games inside the game that you could play to earn Energy instead of having to Wait hours for the refill to reach 100. That would. Be kind of nice.

When I first started playing I loved the game but as you advance it gets harder. The story line is nice until it mentions a same sex crush. To advance in the game it will cost you real money. Energy runs out too fast and if youre lucky youll complete two orders before energy runs out. To sum this all up its a real money hungry game if you want to enjoy playing it. I am deleting the game because it has cost me too much money in a months time.

Although Ive loved this game in the earlier levels, the energy runs out so fast it becomes frustrating at higher levels. High level orders are too complicated, and making a damn coffee mug drains all 100 energy units in 20 seconds, leaving you stuck with no energy and no patience to wait for a refill. Games should entertain, not frustrate. Im uninstalling it as its doing more harm than good in keeping me relaxed in an already stressful life.

Love the game but, like others have said, high energy orders are making it more frustrating than fun. Perhaps raising the amount of max energy regeneration to 200 instead of 100 once you hit higher levels would help? If that could be addressed, I could easily give it 5 stars.

This game, it starts off great. However. at level 16, it starts to charge extra for everything. You might have 20 energy, but youre only getting 7 things. It becomes aggravating and not worth the time or effort around this level. Even when you meet all your goals, you still are gonna be too broke or charged too much its not worth the play or time you have to go back to finish your orders. Which is sad. its your best one! You actually get to choose what your place looks like.

Oops,your ad failed. 10 energy Fun game, though. And, its funny how often Ads Fail and you are given 10 energy for a failed Ad. Significantly less than the ad reward, too or 33 less than 15 energy ad. It happens SO often too, the Ad fails. Its like they get credit for the ad failing and you get 10 energy.

The game is fun and something about merging the items is soothing but once you hit a certain level 100 energy isnt enough to really get anything done making this a pay to play only game. Game creators need to at least allow you to storeearn more energy as you level up and need to use more energy to create things.

Your games are getting ridiculous by the day; this one and the others that Ive played, all ridiculous. How can 100 energy bolts not provide up to 4 merged tea bags? You keep bringing out irrelevant items instead of what one needs, making people waste their energies. Ive been trying to fulfill one order for a week now. If a game gets frustrating, terrible, and hard, it makes the players lose the excitement, and when that happens, players tend to delete it. Listen if you will.

Fun, yet sometimes frustrating. I love the game itself. Most mini games I can participate in to some extent, but as I get higher in levels, it takes hundreds of energy to try and complete the items and when your orders all have high items, it seems like it takes forever to use enough free energy. The other option is to pay for energy or gems. That is the part that is really frustrating

Absolute Cash Grab Gossip Harbour starts fun, then quickly turns into a money trap. Energy runs out in minutes, progress becomes painfully slow, and the only way forward is to PAY  again and again. Difficulty spikes feel fake, rewards are terrible, and every tap triggers another pushy popup. The story is shallow, choices dont matter, and events exist purely to sell overpriced bundles.

At first I was mad that it wasnt like the ads but now Im mad at everything else. Aside from the 38 ad pop ups you may get when opening the game; the event  even customer orders are never random. The best example is the disco party random spin that always gives you the lowest option on the board. The orders are also undervalued, so you can spend a week getting 1 order and get like 24. It gets old fast and has become incredibly boring.

Gossip Harbor is the Best merge game I have played. Regardless of the fact that you have to buy gems and energy it is fun and exciting, you never get bored playing. my input is The Energy runs Out too fast and I recommend that as the level increases, the energy level should increase as well. Also one should be able to gain more energy with data. This way its more thrilling.

I loved playing this game! I was at a VERY high level  had to pay money to get there. I had to uninstall the game due to the money. They only give 100 energy at a time to fill orders. It goes quickly in less than 10 minutes. Then you have to wait hours for it to build back up to be able to play again. There are no ads to watch to get more energy or gems. That is unless you spend money like I did. I put alot of time  money within this game. I just couldnt do it anymore. Please make changes!

This has to be one of my favorite mobile games! The artstyle is great, the items dont take too long to merge, and you can obviously tell that this game is a telltale sign of the developers improvement from previous games. The only way you see ads is by getting bonuses or speeding up cooldowns, and it isnt a pay to win. I also really like the LGBTQ representation, as it isnt in your face and the other characters treat them like they would a straight character.

My issue is that the orders to complete get increasingly more advanced while the amount of ingredients you get are SO LOW that you spend all your coins to complete one or two orders only! Who wants to spend 100 coins and you dont even have enough to complete an order of coffee level 5?! If orders are advanced, then give us more advanced items! Either you buy energy or take days to fulfill 3 orders.

love this game, but the ads they show for this game on other apps are nothing like the actual gameplay. specifically the advertisements I see when Im playing nano crossing. it actually pisses me off and almost makes me not want to play gossip harbor as much because they are caving into the false advertisement other games have. the false advertisement is why Im not giving it 5 stars.

I have been playing this game for a long time, and I still enjoy it. Fun characters and gameplay. Cute story. Some ads, but not intrusive. It would be 5 stars if we could have just a little more storage.

WAY too many merges required to get items  Tiny energy bank of only 100  Some generators only dispense 5 of the starting merge item every few hours  Have to spend coins on tons of stupid story dialogue that doesnt build anything. You only get to build something like maybe every 5th time you spend coins. It is absolutely excruciating having to waste a lot of coin on useless dialogue that I skip.  Can only play 5 minutes at a time b4 youre out of energy ( probably built nothing) BORING

pay to win game. in order to advance in many special events, you have to pay in order to do so even though the ads are like, stop playing games where you have to pay to win! so they basically said dont okay this game because it you want any chance at moving forward with special events, you have to pay, so casual players get left behind. even one of the weekly tasks is, make an in game purchase.  lame. other than that, its an ok game. the whole recharge to merge thing gets annoying

The game is fun and addictive, but I dislike having to spend forever on downloading resources anytime I want to log in. The downloading process takes longer than normal, and its makes one get tired of waiting. I spend almost 45 minutes (if not more) only to download 180.9MB resources, and at the end, it started all over. The app also consumes space day by day.

I deleted Seaside Escape, and now I will be deleting Gossip Harbor. There is a bug (certainly not an accident) that allows the game to cheat you during Rave Reviews. Instead of honoring the number of points originally offered for a large item, it will take away a point and give you another large item. I give this game one star because of the poor response received from customer support. They were of no assistance and instead told me that Im imagining this issue.

I played this game quite a while, and even threw a large bit of money at it. Eventually, I had to quit, due to the cash grab mechanic as you level,  the storyline just got silly. Oh  and if youre considering playing the game going by the ads on the Play Storein other games? Theyre fake. Its nothing like that. Youre helping a gal fix up her restaurant, figure out a mystery, and deal wher hemhawing on choosing who of her various sutors to date. As a merge game, its ok though.

Uninstalled because of how the ads of this game are so annoying and lie. The game itself with its real story is fine, but I refuse to support a game that makes ads for itself so horrible. Add a mute button to your ads, make sure your ads dont start YELLING at people when they start, and start advertising the real game and story and I would play again. Until then, know your advertisement division is losing you customers instead of gaining them.

It was a lot of fun for a long time, but it has reached a point (Level 133) where I cant really complete anything on time for events without spending a lot of money. Ive been perfectly fine spending money regularly, but the amount needed has gotten ridiculous. So Ill stop playing at all. No point playing when you are not spending 100 Euros a month, because you simply wont get any of the events done, which is beyond frustrating.

The aggressive marketing campaign for this game is driving me up the wall. Other aps force me to watch this games 4 minute ad about the sad lady in the snow with her freezing kids 10 times in a row. I feel manipulated and its so bad that it has turned me off to ever wanting to play this game, which I might otherwise be interested in. Seriously, its not cute, its just annoying.

not enough energy. ppl have to pay to get more energy, which is a little too greedy. I spent around 100 and that is not reasonable. that is crazy for 1 merging game. it is fun for a short time, and I want more energy. to get an average order done, takes about 50 energy. so much merging. and competitions. for ppl to pay more. its not a fair game. theres barely any skill involved. ppl who pays the most money, gets the rewards.

Why does it take 150 coins to remove a stack of boxes and see a 10 bubble conversation of nothing? As baskets merge higher i should get higher merged pieces initially. Also if I have a thing where I can get coffee and tea why do I get 20 cups of coffee for 1 tea bag? Also please give more energy points as you level up.

Very addictive, and very stingy with play points (energy) so you have to pay to play essentially unless you want to have 5 minutes of game play followed by 3 hours waiting for recharge and repeat. They do this on purpose and the algorithm knows when you are hooked so they start increasing costs to ridiculous amounts. This isnt a few 1.99 purchases, its 1530 for a couple hours of game play.

I really love the game.I love the concept, the colors, the side games. I could play for hours.But unfortunately, it takes 4 minutes to get 1 energy, and then you max out at a hundred energies. So if youve left the game alone for a few hours, you cant get more than 100. in some of the higher level matches, take 200 or more. So its really annoying, and it makes me want to play other things

Lovely game,but when you download a game,you want to spend some time to relax and not get anxious about rewards because you are always out of energy. In order to play daily for a decent amount of time you have to spend a lot of money! I am sure there are other merge games where with a 20 euro subscription you can enjoy a lot more benefits and not just for two minutes. As you level up,the orders become more and more demanding, and to just complete an order it might take 2 or 3 days time!

The greed is out of control. Not only do they give you very little energy to begin with but they purposely keep you from getting what you want. I had 378 energy (300 from winning a contest) and needed just 1 low level soda. The producer makes coffee and soda. I used all the energy I had and didnt get the low level soda I needed.

I usually liked to buy the extras when I leveled up because you could get some good items for 5 or less a lot of times. But now, the extras are 30. THIRTY DOLLARS?! You people have lost your minds.

no adds like it promises, but does have in game purchases. A fun time sink with a simple gameplay but enjoyable story. How ya merge things determines if this will be a problem or not, but it uses an energy system, so once ya cant merge, and ya have no energy, youll have to wait until tomorrow, or a little while before ya can begin fully playing again. so if this is acceptable over forced ads, and ya live puzzle plus merge gameplay, I highly recommend ya give this game a try.

Lets face it, the dummies that run this game would make a lot more money if they would just let us watch ads to earn energy. The greedy SOBs just want you to load money into the game. Pretty short sighted. Everyone would be happy with ads for energy. Once the easy orders are filled this becomes just another 5 min a day game if you are a free to play player. Play for 5 mins and then come back again tomorrow. Reconsider ads for energy Microfun.

It takes a long time to refund my payment. Not the first time my purchase has been canceled after I completed my payment. The last time I completed my payment on October 28th 2025, but my purchase suddenly canceled after that. But they keep saying that I havent completed the payment yet. I love this game so much. I spent a lot on this game. But for this time, I am not satisfied with their services.

Very nice game but also very stingy with the energies and diamonds. If the energy is full youd only able to play for 510 minutes until it was run out and have to wait several hours again until its full. And its impossible to finish or to win any event without spending money every time. Which is very frustrating and tiring.

Like their other game, Seaside Escape, this game is 100 pay to play. Im not above a fun little micro transaction, but paying 1015 dollars for something that is ultimately unsatisfactory is Not It. The packages you can buy are overpriced, and dont actually help you with your game play. The energy system is brutal  2 minutes for a single energy when it takes at least 100 energy to complete a single order is FOUL. Do better.

This game is a scam. All their ads are manipulating. You think you are helping a mother and child in the snow, but it is not at all the case. It is not a free game. As there is in app purchases that is quite expensive. False advertising and I believe all of these companies should stop these fake ads. it makes you lose your credibility. and the acting is also horrible on your ads, that alone screams FAKE.

Ads say there are no ads. There are optional ads to unlock chest instead of waiting for them to open by themselves after some time. Also optional ads to refill energy to actually play the game or you are stuck waiting or you have to pay. You have to wait or to pay to actually play the game... No cold weather or any house to repair like showed in ads. Im not surprised nor shocked at this point when this amount of lies is allowed in mobile video game industry.

Ive let my energy refill a handful of times now, but theres no dilapidated bedroom with rain or snow coming in and youre fixing it as you play the puzzle.

There are some puzzles in it, but its not the sad story thats advertised. Uninstalled.

Dont waste your time on this game. Its fun until you get to around level 40, then you have to start spending lots of money. Its definitely a pay to play game. Energy takes a long time to regenerate. 100 energy is not enough to merge items at a higher level, hence to why you have to spend money. Also side challenges require spending money to complete.

the game lives up to the ads. you merge stuff and fill orders until you get enough coins to continue the story. then you get gift boxes that let you keep merging. energy runs out pretty fast though and you can only hold 100 at a time. once you level up, it takes several hundreds or thousands of energy to complete orders. that really sucks.

It was enjoyable at first but as you advance in levels it becomes more and more timeconsuming to complete items. Constantly having to build and rebuild the same items to combine them 57 times to create a new item gets boring. I also find getting certain items uses so much energy. Having to use 100 energy to complete the basic tea is ridiculous.

The primary gameplay of merging items to complete restaurant orders is kinda fun, however, with each level you advance, the items for each order become more and more difficult to obtain. If youre not spending money, some orders take 2 or 3 days to complete. Thats ridiculous. The racing events are terrible, they require so many resources, almost no one wins, and it costs 100s and 100s of energy units. Designed for pay to play and huge time suck (hours per day). If thats not you, dont download

The game was kinda fun for a bit, played for a while but stopped and am uninstalling bc customer service wont replace items even when its their fault. Not only that but there is a point where you cannot earn anything by watching ads, not extra energy or anything as a ploy to make people spend more money. which sadly I did spend a fair amount. issue with their glitch and not making it right had to do with the fact that it happened when I DID spend money. they dont care abt their customers.

Games are supposed to be for youfor relaxation and fun. This game is against you, fighting for your money. The longer I stay in the game, the greedier it gets. It gets worse and worse with each new level. The rewards for competitions and minigames are super difficult to get without spending real money, and the rewards themselves become so meager that its not worth the effort. I made 1 to 3 purchases every week, and still couldnt finish the monthly pass, and many games even with that!

Brilliant game!! The creators are geniuses for this game!! Matching and merging items on the board gives an urge to complete orders, the suspense to read up on the storyline is the game plus more. Through the play and earn apps, Ive been earning gift cards to continue playing. I do enjoy all of the prizes thats dished out after paying a little into it. However, It has gotten to be very pricey with the bigger orders, so much that its not affordable enough to play all day if I wanted.

I went from 3 stars to 1. Was fun to play but it is not as advertised and takes a lot of real money to get any real play time. If I didnt spend real dollars, I can only play 5 to 10 mins. and then have to wait for hours for enough energy to play again. Found myself spending 10  DAILY  just to keep playing a little longer. I mentioned this in my original 3 star review which is now nowhere to be found. Prepare to spend a lot of real money or wait around a lot for energy to regenerate!

Game crashesreboots way too often! On my Lenovo tablet, I watch ads in order to get rewards (i.e.: energy, boxes of extras), and after the ads have played, the game either crashes, or reboots, and I get a message, Oops! The ad failed to load. Heres 10 energy. Its not so bad when Im trying to get 15 energy (I only lose out on 5), but when its something more substantial, its starting to get VERY ANNOYING!

the game is awesome. i do appreciate the no ads. it I get less irritated when there are little to no ads (to a point where I almost slame my phone on the ground(I have anger issues)). the way you false advertised your game is sad. you could have just told the truth about the game instead of making it over dramatic. its a great game otherwise.

I was enjoying the game until it required actual money for you to progress faster. now I think I prefer games that makes me watch ads to get gifts, this is extortion energy takes hours to refill when u dont pay for energy, u dont get to win any challenge I regret spending my hard earned money on dis stupid game

Cole is so annoying dude like jesus christ. I cant believe theyre pushing this drama and love triangle between quinn, cole, and harrison as IF cole is such a catch  a large majority of the characters are just so unbearable and theres like 3 that are okay (they can never make me hate you mark, harrison, and sam). if youre looking for a good storyline, dont even bother downloading the game because 90 of the time youre just frustrated with how dumb some of the characters are.

this is the second time Ive started playing this game and I really like it. its got a great storyline and its not too easy and not too difficult to beat. it keeps you entertained for a while. I started playing this though a money making app and it is so much better than some games Ive forced myself to play for a few dollars. I love matchmaking games but this one was well made and its very enjoyable. I have zero to complain about.

Not as advertised but it is a merge game. You fix areas with points not as indicated. Quite fun despite false advertising. Only problem was when they choose the furniture and it does not match or is childish for the area being fixed up.

rip off! Ive spent quite a bit on this game which runs out fast. you get very close to completing the events or you complete some and the grand prize isnt that good. To top it off, even with gold packs, you hardly het any new cards so a couple of hours to go and I havent completed the set. I have spent quite a bit so I dont feel its fair. I will definitely be deleting as it is really not worth it.

Ads Lie Like many have said the ads are deceptive. its just a classic merge game that requires energy and has constant events going. Very pushy for pay to play as well as top ups which can be cheap but get you no where in the long run. Now if it was like the ads it may be a decent game. Im a fairly high level with a lot unlocked and far into the story, I have given it the benefit of the doubt.

I highly recommend not playing this game. It is so incredibly frustrating. Everything is just designed to get you to spend more and more money on the game. I get that its a business, but you constantly have to spend money to enjoy the game. For example, to complete a single order thats available to me, it could take me 2100 energy. The maximum free energy that you can accumulate over time is 100! Find a game that isnt so predatory in trying to get you to spend money.

good game, but as usual its made to force u to spend money so u enjoy it, 100 energy refill is not enough to make a high lvl sandwish let alone finish one order a day. its not fair to push people to buy so they enjoy it not everyone have this luxury, if u can make it fair by allowing us to harvest more energy somehow by playing something on the side or to give us more then 100 refill a day it would fix it, because we cant play this game except for 2 mins a day

This game basically just keeps you winning small victories, but youll never win the events unless you sink a substantial amount of money into it. I say a substantial amount because I sank a reasonable amount in and still couldnt finish an event, to see if it was possible. The game is a money trap.

It is a complicated play to win game, that wants you to pay money to exceed, so by the time you finish it, you dont know you spent a fortune of a hundreds of bucks. Not anything like advertised, and it expects you to keep pushing the power button to advance, as it has a high counter on energy cost to repeatedly force you to make a mixed item at that exceeded energy cost, its a ripoff.

Nothing like the teaser, no poor woman and child in the snow. Crafted to get you to constantly buy energy. Technically free but only for about 5 minutes. Then you wait hours unless you pay. If you have bought energy and are over the 100 units nothing replenishes until you are under 100 and then it stops at 100 even if you are gone for hours. Puts up match requests that cannot be met on 100 units. You get the idea. Too expensive to play and have much fun.

Im playing Buggle2, and in order to get 2 additional moves, I have to watch an ad. Unfortunately, the ad that I am forced to watch is the one with the mom, little girl, and baby. The name of the game is shown as Gossip Harbor, which is incorrect. After sitting through the incorrectly named ad, the Buggle2 game freezes (frequently), I dont get the additional moves, and I have to restart.

You will not do any of this in the ad. You have to spend money to complete anything because most events are hard. The five star cards are rare and hard to get so you never complete those sets. Its a story game but I didnt read it anymore I just skip for the rewards which are mediocre. I just decided to stop playing and uninstalled it......

This MIGHT be a great game BUT the creators dont increase your energy to correlate with the increased amounts needed as you reach higher levels. The orders become more complex, and it becomes impossible to do anything on 100 energy. So you can play an average of about 2 MINUTES and have to stop playing again and come back HOURS later. Not a good way to keep players using your game! And they dont even offer watching ads as a way to earn more energy! They refuse to address this problem! GREEDY!

This game is pointless. it is a constant cycle to get more energy and or diamonds. Some players get videos others not. Some get extra racoon based chests which lead to more items and energy bottles others not. spend real money in the game and you potentially lose the videos. So you are penalised for spending money. what kind of business strategy is that? I saved two blue chests, a red chest and other restaurant goals for today. three red bottles  250 energy later, I get a frozen. Total con!

Im ridiculously involved in the storyline to this game, despite it being screamingly annoying  dumb at times  I just want to get to the end  find out who done it. You dont get enough energy to do things but the random special events do help with that. Basically if you want a game where you can switch off, this is that game... Im playing it thru Mistplay so at least I receive vouchers for hitting goals.

Good game, but all of a sudden, there was a change in the daily tasks requirements. 350 cards? 24,000 coins? 280 good reviews? How is that even possible? Lets be realistic. Not all orders give cards, and the energy needed to complete some of these orders goes waaaay beyond the 100 cap energy the game allows us. Which is totally bizarre. Either increase the max energy cap to 300 or reduce the energy recharge time or, better still, give us realistic numbers to achieve in the restaurant goals.

As others have stated, this is not the game in the ads. It is a merge to fill orders game with very limited energy and increasingly difficult orders. 100 energy and orders that each take several hundred merges to fill and pay very little. Generator parts are near impossible to come by so your generator gives 6 parts hourly and 3 orders for something that takes 64 of them. Timed events run out long before you can complete them. Levelling up takes forever and doesnt refill energy. No thanks.

You definitely have to pay to win . I spent so much money on this game to win and still didnt win . Pretty sure it will take about 80100 to win and that is just 1 out of 6 tournaments a month . VERY EXPENSIVE TO WIN . Plus , there was glitch in their system and they would not honor my 250 gems .. chose to argue and then ignore me. Pure greed and no respect . The story line is great but spending your money is pointless because u wont win off buying a single package ... it will take A LOT .

3 stars for fun game with fun storyline, but way too expensive to play for any length of time  their game additions range from 8.99 to 19.99 which is a DAILY cost if you want continuous play. I dont mind paying 1.99 to 4.99, but the daily cost is ridiculous. otherwise, I would have given 5 stars.

Decided to do an experiment and spend even more money this month on certain things. The offers for special packages keep going up each time. The special events are rigged so that you get close but dont win unless you buy an exclusive card package. The game might be fun, but its a total scam. Its like a skill crane. Its too bad. Deleting now, they proved my point. Spent 100 last month on this game and still couldnt complete the special events.

Ive been playing for 2 years, and its excellent, but it can get expensive. Whatever psychology is spent here works, lol... Ive spent maybe 400 on this game, and thats the only downside. Its almost impossible to win all the challenges without energy, and it takes a long time to generate it organically. That said.. Its amazing otherwise. Edited, its nearly impossible to merge needed items without a purchase. A whole life of 100 is not enough...

I Im really loving this game! The storys super engaging, totally hooks me in. The merge mechanic is perfect; super easy for new merge game players to pick up, but still tons of cool stuff to combine and create. No ads at all is a huge plus, makes the game feel way more immersive. My only tiny issue is how fast the energy drains and then takes a while to recharge, but its really not a huge problem.

Ive been playing this for over a year  just saw the most blatantly false ad for it. A redhaired man said he is the boss of the game, and it is completely free to play, and you can win it without paying anything. First, it isnt a finished game, and the story is still being written via updates. Second, its impossible to fill enough orders with the extremely limited energy you can earn before it stops collecting, unless you spend money. Finally, the ad shows game mixes that arent in it.

Gave this 5 stars because its my favorite game. There are plenty of challenges and ways to earn diamonds, energy, etc. I am however disappointed with one aspect. I always purchase the Endless rewards pass, last month purchased the super VIP pass, no matter how fast Im moving through it. Im never able to complete the month and get all of the rewards. It starts out at 29 days and I never get the last three or four rows of prizes. Ill tell you this I wont be spending money on it again.

Im currently at level 98, and the game feels slow and has become an irritation. Orders take too long to complete, rewards are too small, and upgrades are hard to achieve. Renovations cost too many coins, even for small tasks, and there are too many overlapping events. It takes days to finish a single order, with or without spending money and Ive spent quite a bit. Its become a money pit!! Feedback from the company is absolutely rubbish and automated responses. In the game: useless!!

you guys are criminals, you are only looking for ways to extort money from player. one, you dont give enough energy to play games, then you bring out tasks for someone to complete within a time frame knowing fully well that energy provided will be exhausted and the only way to get more...is by buying more. you bring out lot of dishy discount items for one to buy; in different ways possible. you just want players to keep spending their money on a slow...stupid game. This is fraud.

its a nice game and ihv been playing for countless days and am now at level 100 but I was hoping if there could be a chat feature so that players can communicate and also share experience. The reason I gave it four  is because the energy recharge limit isnt quite helping and also the duration for tasks

Ive been playing for a few months now. I like the game itself. They used to give a free chest of a small amount of energy daily. Thats gone now. As well as one of the two ads to allow 15 energy. Its definitely more pay to play than it used to be. That makes it really impossible to complete weekly tasks and events. I could play all day using energy as it comes in and still only complete one order. Once you become a higher level player, you get no ads, spend cash. Dropped a star.

The ads for this game and the beginning of this game is inappropriate for children. The beginning encourages gambling because theyre at a casino. The ads also show topics that are sensitive. What kind of child would like to see two people freezing in the cold? Game is good, just change the beginning and ads to be childappropriate.

Ive played this game for two years now and I really regret it. The events are almost impossible to complete and the more you buy energy in the hopes that you can complete orders and in extensions get events points you just get to stages where you have to spend and even when you buy their packages its all a waste because the events will end without you reaching your goal. Plus energy being sold for 10 gems, then the 20 gems at next purchase then 40 gems and 80 gems really crazy.

(25 stars) I dont like that this game quickly turns into a pay to keep playing setup. You only get 100 energy, and it runs out way too fast. After just a few minutes of playing, youre forced to wait for energy to rechargeor pay for morejust to keep going. It really kills the fun and makes it hard to stay interested.

Downloaded from an ad I saw. Was disappointed that it was nothing like the ad. The ad promised one thing, and the game delivered something completely different. Yes, it is a merge game, just not what was advertised. Im also confused as to how this has a 4.6 rating when theres nearly triple the onestar reviews as there is 5 star reviews. Played the game for 5 minutes and instantly knew it would end up becoming unplayable real soon, due to the energy cost required to do anything.

If I could, I would rate this 0 STARS. Not only are they falsely claiming how the game looks and that it is Exactly what it is in the ad, they also overexagerate about how poor the family REALLY is. They lie about the game in the AD, but they do it in a way that makes saying that everything is false. There arent even LEVELS. they said OH we have 10000 unique levels, when there wasnt levels to begin with. Basically, this game is a lie by using word play. Absolute garbage.

fun but takes too long to advance to the next level. You run out of energy wayyyy too quickly and they dont give you very much opportunity to gain any like watching ads, games, etc unless you pay for it.

While the game itself, especially in the beginning, was fun,the amount of energy needed to complete some orders can take a few days! There used to be ads you could watch to increase energy, however that is no longer an option. It really feels like the developers are doing this so that people will spend money in order to complete tasks. I am not at all impressed with this game for those reasons and will be uninstalling it.

Normally the game offers an energy chest if you watch ads, once a day. After I bought a pass from the game with real money, now it wont let me watch ads for energy chest reward. It just gives it to me if I pay gems for it. Needless to say I will never buy anything from this game ever again. Edit: its not random at all. Ive watched an ad for the chest for over 5 months everyday. And now I cant watch them at all, after buying the pass. Of course its not coincidental.
