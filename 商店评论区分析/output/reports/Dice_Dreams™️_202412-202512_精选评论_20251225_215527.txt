being both a professional gamer  beta tester, Ive played my fair share of mobile games. Most were fun, but Dice Dreams is highly addicting! Everything from gameplay, sound effects (which are both hilarious and cute) to way too many things to get into! I also love the fact that you can steal and attack random people, which in my case, has led to me making new friends! 1010 must have casual game! not an issue found!

Love this game.. I just wish you could win dice easier after about 6 rolls of the dice you dont get anything to help.. other then that the game is super fun... I have been saving rolls and have plenty for now. Im editing this soany pop up ads game freezes all the time or slows down and I get now place fast. Had 5 stars but its only a 3 now. IN THE PAST 2 WEEKS THE ADS HAVE SLOWED DOWN. ITS SO MUCH NICER TO PLAY. THANK YOU FOR ACTUALLY DOING SOMETHING TO HELP !!! I LOVE HOW CUTE THIS

Fun attack and shield game. The animations are cute and fun to watch, ads when collecting certain coins of course, but not too bad. Simple but addictive and I havent seen any money payout yet, as theres a long list of tasks to complete 1st, but I havent been consistently playing it either. Will update if I ever finish the tasks and actually see a payout. But still fun, even if for the animations in the different games in the tournaments they do.

Love this game, but Ive been having issues. I can play but if I get in a free dice mini game or something else that the music changes. But when I get back to the main game, the music will play the main music and the mini game music at the same time. Plus, the game tells me to update all the time, even when it doesnt need too and then the music will be glitched.

I wish had more coupons tailored to my games without having to use points. But I love Google except they quit supporting my printer. Noooo. Cant print unless use my Windows. The new color Lazer printer all in one is expensive. But what if I buy and then they wont support in future. Over all. I pay for Google. Just need to figure out how to put photos on safe storage. Full again. My fault because do not know why phone saves everything  Thank you Google.  FAN4life

Thank for keeping in contact The pop up offers have now become aggressively accessive  intrusive. I get the need for sponsors, but the number of times the (12 ) offers pop up after any move aside rolling is appauling... Love the way its designed,  its not anywhere near as glitchy as the similarly opposing games to the early editions of this game that were slow, display of graphics  crashed all the time with actual game board to have pawns navigate on around  with. Thank you!!

Update: Contacted support and was basically to get over it. Im tired of having to work harder to finish events just because Im at a higher level and have more dice. They jack up the number of points you need to finish an event level according to the number of rolls you have. The trail rewards and mission rewards have gotten smaller but it takes more to get them. Its getting ridiculous. Like right now on the Showtime Madness thing, I have to roll 40,000 dice to complete the first level.

The events end too soon there is not enough time to level up as the events take too long to complete in addition I see you make it impossible for folks who choose to play the game free to gain to get as the stickers or keep pets The events still take too much to complete I dont think you allow folks that play free ever be able to keep the pets or complete the stickers update you should give folks a second chance at pets when they are in the last levels so they can get them!

the game was great, until it stopped offering ads to get more dice. UPDATE: it gets to a point that its impossible to progress, without spending. and even then, 5 or 10, wont help really at all. there are teams, an alliance type of function, but it is totally pointless, as the only thing you can do with it, is request dice. and even then, you can only request 6 dice. pointless function, that really needs reworked, considering the money this game is making.

Addictive and fun, cant stop playing. the game has changed quite a lot. I am disappointed that the team missions didnt ever really take off. Some of the activities are almost impossible to complete without spending money. the Trails can be crazy expensive to get the next box (20k points or more). I think that money should be there for people who want to get there fast but committing game time should allow you to get there too.

I love this game. I want to ask superplay to consider creating an option to send a friend e.g. 25(or more, less) cookies, a few cannons, a few symbols for the top right offer, 25 or other amount trail steps, an ingredient for Frankie, a couple of pickaxes, or anything that is relevant for the events that are going on at the time. I guess sending ur family or BFF a super is not going to be an option dead mans wish but the first request I think is not unreasonable and will get a lot of support

Such an adorable game! No forced ads!! They update the game every 9 to 12 hours or so, so theres always something new! Beautiful graphics, fun and different themes for the levels and seasonal card collecting! I started playing this game through VYBS, getting paid to hit certain levels, but Im definitely going to keep playing!

so far Im loving this game its easy enough to not need too much of your attention on the screen but rewarding enough to make it fun. could be addictive Ive played a little longer and the game does glitch and freeze when its supposed to pay. eventually it restarts its self and u have to go thru the start up process on the plus side the rolls and coins are still there when you finally get back to the actual playing of the game. its still fun til it happens again  fix it please

Good game but Issues are on making friends...! Why inviting people who are not coming to make a friend list.Make it that you add friends from the club and also add friends from the game not inviting them via Facebook or other social media.it is difficult to have a friend list as many dont follow the links to make your friends.

This game is Awesome its so much fun!! It is Free to play  very fun  enjoyable for any age! You can buy things if you want to. This is one of my favorite games.. The main goal of the game is to build each kingdom then you reach the next level. Its so exciting  entertaining. You can invite your friends to play with you. All you have to do is attack  raid other players and build your kingdom.I would give it 10  stars if I could...

I have been playing this game for quite a while and it is by far my favorite game. I ride the train between Dallas and Fort Worth often and you can bet Im playing Dice Dreams with my friends. I love the games within the game that make it something different every so often. The graphics are beautiful and the Peons are so fun. Super fun game and very competitive with my group of friends. I would recommend this game to anyone.

I mean I like the game, but why do I need to pay a buck So that I can pay for the third one. When you get to the third one whenever you start the game, you literally have to pay. Like if this game never had no money, then I would play This Forever. But fun game. But I hate. The fact that I need to pay Why do I need to? Like I get like 8 popups. And its very annoying also stupid p2w game i cant even get the grand prize without spending two dollars on this game just to complete a level bro why

Always fun but chances of winning are LOW so watch your . The prices  what you get for how much you spend in order to keep playing is tricky. The highest cost is not ALWAYS the best deal  the cheapest thing is usually exactly what you paid for it. I guess they never claimed that it was inexpensive entertainment ! The prices are finally coming down now to affordable amounts! Yay! I didnt think I would see the day!!! I really wish that free rolls for watching ads was still A thing

I enjoy playing this game, but without in app purchases you dont get very far. I wish that the dice offered more free rolls, and that there werent so many special offers to take up the screen. I think that this game could definitely be enjoyable long term but then I would also probably be out thousands of dollars. You could make the packages worth more, more dice rolls, more coins, more puzzle pieces, or spins on the trail. it just doesnt make sense that any package is over 2.99.

This game constantly cheats me out of my gifts. When I message customer service along with my game ID they always tell me they have no record of my account. They barely give you dice as it is even in the team challenges. EDIT The game has improved a lot. No glitches has happened in over a year. My only concern now is my team no longer receives challenges. Seems were only there to gift dice to each. I did update my stars.

Super fun love playing this game. Trying hard to win my little pet, game is very exciting. Love my game DICE DREAMS. Still loving it  love. Playing is awesome but I wish you would get more to at least clear your album when you spend so much money or basically get close to doing so getting different pages to clear the albums. After PAYING 2 times for more dice and prizes THE GAME WENT OUT HAD TO RELOAD AND DIDNT RECEIVE ALL MY PAID PRIZES LOOK INTO THE ISSUE!!!!

This was a pretty fun game with many enjoyable aspects. I cant say much without restating what others have said. One issue I have is that the option to watch ads for dice vanished and Im not sure why. I was dependent on watching ads and now I cant do that anymore. Ive checked the setting to see if I could turn on the ads again, but it was to no avail. Feel free to let me know how I can get ads for dice again.

The game is good. It could be great if it didnt take away the pet progress. Isnt the time frame good enough? Cookies are hard to get and people on disability cant afford to buy them. My friends and I have been playing through 6 pets and havent got one yet. Can you stop taking away the pet progress? The ovetall time frame should be sufficient.

To get the free rewards, many of the ads dont grant the reward because theres no way to close the ad. HERES HOW: For the ads with the install button directly at the bottom, or with ones with the logo on the bottom right, let it play a few seconds, slightly minimize like youre switching between tabs (android), rotate horizontally and click the black space along the top. These are the google play  ads you cant close and thus gain the reward. An X button should appear and viola! Reward!

Just be careful because this game is very addicting You will invest a lot of time and money into it and if something goes wrong customer support doesnt care. I did an update like the game suggested and suddenly the upgrades I worked very hard on were not there anymore in my kingdom. I reached out to customer support, they tried to tell me they couldnt find a problem and unwilling to reimburse the coins that they stole from me instead of making it right would rather lose a player. Uninstalled.

The Game Is A Fun Addictive Game To Play... What I Dont Like Is The Glitches That Occur During Promotional Deal... What I Also DISLIKE, Is The Looooong Wait You Have To Endure While They Correct Their Mistakes... Youll Make Your Purchase So You Can Receive The Promotion... And You Dont Get The Promotion You Only Get What You Paid For... So You Put In A Ticket To Fix But It Takes Three Days To Get A Response.. It Didnt Take Them Three Days To Take Your Money

Have been playing for a while now and its a good game. Ive enjoyed it but its getting to a point of never finishing the pets, albums or events without spending actual money is ridiculous. I play every day and its been like this for months. maybe just my experience but its kinda discouraging to want to continue to play. I will give 5 stars for the graphics and the consistency of the events and different little things to do like the trails, the acorn hunt, garden buddies etc.

Its perfect to unwind with this one. The only thing Id change is some sounds. They (2)(when you catapult the red one and it screams,and some other one, I think when you accomplish a building(?) not sure about my 2nd sound (I will check again and edit)) tend to be oversaturated and pointy on a higher volume level. They are funny nevertheless

The more you give the more this game wants. The wheel you spin for treasure boxes amazes me how it can always land on the 1, 2, 3 between the 50 and 100 steps every time. If I have enough coins, gems etc to cash in on a prize I should be able to move forward without paying actual money on the pop ups its added

Love this game, the little characters are so funny. my only complaint is that the invite friends reward dont work.

The game would be fun if it wasnt loaded with paywalls.The fact that, when Im rolling, I have to make sure I dont run out of roles, because if I do 4 paywalls pops up is ridiculous.They interrupt your roles on purpose and have things that come up that theyre just to drain your time , especially if you have buffs. I connected my Facebook and for some odd reason.My friends arent showing, so I asked to unconnected, and they were like you cant do that.We are working on a fix,so I miss out smh

Dice Dreams is a captivating blend of strategy and luck, set in a whimsical world where players roll dice to build and expand their own kingdoms. The game features colorful graphics and charming animations that enhance the overall experience. One of the standout elements is its social aspect, allowing players to visit friends kingdoms and engage in friendly competition.

This game is actually a cool game. It took a lil while of me playing to understand what was what but hey thats any new game rite?. There are a cuple things that could be improved on, the ability to make free dice, build up progress for the spin bord  the fact that it feels like you MUST PAY FOR ANY DICE OVER 100. THE CONSTANT FLIPPING OF DEALS SUCKS... But if you deal with that youd like this dice game. Try it !

and now ever since the last update every time I play one round of something at boots me out of the game completely. probably going to delete this game very soon! Update: NEARLY every time I watch a video to get free dice, I go through the video  the only option qhen its done playing is it takes me to the play store. when I hit the back button, it starts the game over again. it seems that many people have the same comments in their reviews, so why is nothing being done to fix it? ANNOYING!!

Im liking the new updates . Well Facebook is at it again they keep blocking My Game Posts and thats why I dont have any friends to play the game also. I REALLY THINK THAT FACEBOOK WILL DEFINITELY BE DELETING MY POSTS FOR THE GAME AND LETTING ME KNOW THAT I REALLY NEED TO LOOK AT PORN AND FOR THAT I REALLY DONT WANT TO DO THIS BUT YOU HAVE TO LOSE ANOTHER STAR IM SORRY.

Edit: seems the developers improved by adding MORE popups Decent tap and forget idle dice roll type game (essentially the same as the one with the top hat mascot and all the commercials) But holy popups, batman! By the time the popups are done loading after startup, Ive forgotten what game Ive even opened. A bit much, would be accurate at 50 of the popups, here. Really should consider toning that waaaaaay down. Popups are overstimulating, also, so if thats an issue for you, be warned.

Ive been playing for about a year now  its always a bit glitchy but ever since the new update the other day, it gives me an error code message  wont even let me load the game. Ive done all of the things: restarting my device, clearing cache, uninstalling  reinstalling, etc with no change. It says error code 255. It sucks but guess Ill just have to delete  find something else to play. A few others that also play have said theyve encountered the same issue. all on diff devices  networks

I had to change my review I did have 5 stars and used to spend mad money on this game. about 6 months ago the game changed and started crashing on me literally every 3 minutes. funny thing is it always crashes when I make a purchase before I get that purchase or win a reward before the reward is distributed the game will crash and when I reboot it up I no longer get said reward or whatever purchase I had made .. but the game has no problem taking my money or my spins! im about done

I like the game well enough but for two things: 1) Constant in game pop ups make the game almost unplayable. Sure at start up, but after each and every time you run out of dice? No thank you. Updated: 2) When I watch an ad for a reward I expect to GET the reward not get kicked from the game. The fix suggested in the devs reply worked nicely and I suggest anyone else experiencing the same issue to try it.

at first, the progress was doable and challenging but once you reach kingdoms 70 or higher dont expect to gain much of the trail tokens, puzzle pieces etc. you wont get far on the limited rolls given and the only way to maybe move on the next kingdom is if you purchase an overpriced offer. also any percentage they discount is incorrect they i.e. offer prices at 59.99 with their discount applied at 20 is 49.99 when mathematically it should be 47.99. the price is outrageous w or wout discount

SO AS IVE STUCK WITH THE GAME AFTER reaching out to support several times they resolved some of the issues and others are still same. My advice is enjoy it in the beginning bc especially if your able to watch videos for dice and trail count bc they offer videos and dice in the trail to SOME players not all. I know several ppl that played to confirm. Its not right to lower rewards the further you progress in a game or to offer videos for free dice to some players not others.

RIP OFF!!! Support tickets IGNORED. Charged many times for single purchases. Rules say: can request refund if NOT received. UPDATE RULES STATING WE WILL NOT BE REFUNDED. They admit I didnt get anything, several times, gifting me a build boost when I have no gold, or extra win with no dice. Saying they appreciate my feedback, will help future updates. Irrelevant to me. 40 days of play was way too much. I tried to be fair. DONE! Developers dont usually read our tickets! RATING 0 HUGE REGRET

I really like the game until I got cheated out of the rest of my purchase this morning and I still havent gotten the items! Just some generic message about them looking into it!?! Now its been about 12 hours later and Nothing! The game lags and often returns to the Google play store whenever I make a purchase or try to attach screenshots to support team for my missing items!!! This really sucks! Play it but dont make any purchases bc theyll cheat you out of your money, you wont get item!

Either its that or I havent figured out how to earn enough cookies to get a pet. I just cant afford to buy one. Otherwise, I enjoy the game even with not having a pet.

this game was fun until it required me to pay to get to the next dice roll, or I could harass my friends who dont play games on their phone so that I can move to the next level. I will find another game to play but maybe this is not the app for me because Im not here to spend what money I dont have since I am homeless and just trying to occupy my time, add potentially make a little money so I can buy some food.

Nice pretty visuals and entertaining sounds. Repetitive gameplay. Way too many points of buy this, purchase that, spend spend spend. Every time Im low on dice Im treated to a barrage of 5 or 6 offers. The worst part is, like most games they offer free dice or construction for watch an ad. Except that ad ALWAYS resets the application and you NEVER get your promised reward. Shady business tactics.

The game is mostly fun. However, your progress is constantly grinding to a halt for chances to buy packs or purchase items like food for your pet to progress. This makes the natural grind for F2P players even longer than it should.

Game glitches a lot. Its honestly a fun game but you have to spend  often to get any real bonuses. Game also kind of cheats. Youll spin a wheel to get moves. It will clearly be going to a high number and at the last second you can clearly see the momentum changes to bump the wheel to the lower number. Better games to play. Id pass on this one. One other thing I forgot they will cheat you on rewards for tournaments  tell you you got them. Cant believe I wasted my time

Dont waste your time on this game.

UPDATE I lowered my score again because of how petty the game is. its ok at the beginning and the farther I got the more time it took to complete a stage. now I try to remember to check it in the morning and at night to roll my dice only to just use them up with 1 of 50 upgrades complete. once in a while there is a exciting moment when you make some progress but I dont think its enough to keep playing.

This is a fun game, but be aware of some cons. The popups to make purchases are annoying. The boost option is the biggest con. It defaults to the highest boost available when you open the app. If you forget, you waste a lot of rolls. I had 45,000 extra rolls and usually do a boost of 25. I opened the app and forgot to change the boost until 4 rolls in. I went from 45,000 rolls to 8500 because it defaulted to 8000 boost. Very deceitful. I could go on but Im out of characters to write more.

Overall its a very unique game for younger kids, although the amount of coins you get while rolling the dice should be more seeing how it takes thousands to build the castle. They multiplier your winnings should increase. Easy game for younger ones to advance and build your castles. Although Im still trying to figure out what the story line is about....

This game is one of the best allaround for daily play and content creation  the side games, lightning runs, and adventure pass make progression exciting. Ive spent money, watched ads, and played consistently because I truly enjoy it. However, this is the second time Ive lost over 100,000 dice points after purchases due to glitches.

Dice Dreams is an engaging and cheerful game that mixes luck, strategy, and a fun social vibe. Rolling the dice to build your kingdom feels rewarding, and the animations are bright and lively. Every turn brings a surprise, whether it is earning coins, unlocking new characters, or defending your village from playful attacks. What stands out most is the balance between casual fun and progression.

It was a fun game until they started using ads for things, and their ads never pay out! I watched the exact same pizza game ad 7 times yesterday, and on the last attempt, I left it open for 20 minutes, and it never gave me a way to end it! It shows an arrow and Google Play Store next to it, and that just takes you to the Play Store. The game reloads when you go back. never giving credit to build or win the video watch reward. it is very irritating to inform support, and they blow you off.

Its a fun game  to play, but  yes theres a, BUT!!! Why is it that this game does nothing, but cheat you out of getting to your next goals by always giving WAY MORE Jackpots than Anything Else. Then on top of that lets not forget how many times it takes ALL your dice, so then your left short of what your trying to get as a reward. Thinking seriously about Uninstalling this Dice Dreams, because of the levels of screwing you over when it comes to any prize games. Hopefully they fix this.

the amount of pop ups you have to deal with as soon as you open the game makes it almost unbearable to play at times. yes I know there are things I COULD purchase, I dont want to. the fact that im forced to see every single offer and be explained how to play every single minigame despite the fact ALL of the mini games are reused from previous one. I shouldnt be forced to see how to play a game youve already had 7 different variations of

this game is a great time passer and that is the only reason for 3 stars. I made one or two purchases and they went fine and then the pixie shadow offer came up so I decided why not? I never got the purchase instead it charged me but right when it loaded it said something went wrong and never gave me it. so I tried to talk to support about it...no one contacted me so thats a joke.. so I went on the Google play store and requested a refund they gave it and I tried to buy it again.. nothing again

Very trash, self advertising is absolutely a game breaker because it comes everytime you cant afford to roll the dice. it is very repetitive and genuinely boring, but the saving grace is the daily reward an app like free cash gives you for using it, so you can make a penny a day and spin the rewards wheel. The game itself is utter boredom though.

I really enjoyed the game its a great game to play when youre bored or want to pass the time definitely recommend this game 100! Update I have a complaint for some reason when I try to tap on the infinite dice or free rolls it only lets me do it a limited amount of times which is strange because yesterday and the days before it let me tap on it infinitely and let me get infinite dice was it a bug,was it a glitch or was it intentional? so update again I am right now experiencing game crashes

I just wanted to add even though I do love this game in my opinion if you would make it to where you dont have to reset the creature every 3 More people might play, especially if you spend money to buy cookies. I love this game and have spent allot of money even though Im on disability I play every day and I dont. I think people would play if it was easier for them to get the creatures. In So many of the games I play thats what most people want.

Great game, but I would rate it 5 stars IF after watching an ad the game didnt automatically restart WITHOUT any reward, making you watch another ad (RESTARTS AGAIN)  makes you watch it many more times before it finally gives the reward for watching it. Its nearly every ad now. So, to get a single reward, you have to watch several ads after the game RESTARTS again and again and again. Updated several times, but even that doesnt fix it. Im SURE its a way to generate revenue multiple times!

Fun, easy play! This is exactly the kind of lazy game I was looking for. Its mundane in what you need to do, but still has enough variety to make it interesting. The only downside for me is that I get frustrated having to wait for the animations to process. Id like to see an option button added in the settings to speed those up for people who would rather just enjoy as few interruptions as possible.

After playing this game for months. Its so fun. The higher you get in the game its impossible to continue without a massive supplies of winnings. You cannot win these, or enough of them to keep going. I have spent a massive amount of money so I deleted the game. It is fun and wish I could continue but it is terribly expensive to play. Stop playing once you get to the point of not earning enough prizes. The ads are ridiculous and all the time!

Do not play to win cash, repetitive. I played this game expecting to reach milestones with freecash. This game requires barely any skill and is moreso based on luck, which is ok. My biggest issue is the game makes you see adds to add more dice rolls. When nearly reaching a milestone, like the offer for 40 dollars to reach level 40, the game turns adds off 3 levels prior to making it. This is scammy and baiting behavior and it will seriously make you mad to be blocked right at the end.

Lets U watch ads  get items but when youre at higher levels  click on the watch ad button it says no ads available If ads arent available then stop showing the button 4 them!!!  Also game pops up 4 options 2 buy items EVERY SINGLE TIME U run out of dice for a multiplier. They then drop your multiplier down to fit the number of dice you have left  IT DOES THE SAME THING.... rinse  repeat . ONCE IS ENOUGH, Not every single time until you run out  I understand U need ads but come on!

honestly quite frustrating because in order to progress passed a certain point it costs a absolutely ridiculous amount of money and on top of that if you do pay money at a certain point once you progress enough to finish things half the rewards you get becomes useless which makes for a very not fun play experience. Unless you have quite a lot of money to toss away or really like super slow progress, pass on this game 010 do not recommend. I foresee myself deleting this app in the near future.

I really wish I could open the game and just play it. I hate having 15 things popping up with all of them having to do with spending money on a stupid game. Can you please fix that cause its really annoying to the point where people quit cause all the game developers want is money, and when you run out of dice, boom 5 more pop ups! Worse than Spam on a public computer! If people really wanted to waste their money on your game Im sure they would know how to click on the buttons.

SCAM ALERT! on the apps like freecash this company will scam you. I completed their reward tasks on there and the rescinded their money offers even though I did what was asked. stay away from this company! I watched 100s of ads. You people are the ones paying these apps so you get people to play your games. money doesnt come from the 3rd party. they said it was you which I believe. dont associate with them. they specifically said it was your co. that took  away from me. your response is a lie

My experience with this game has been horrible. Yet Again! Please I warn you dont download this scam of an app. I made a purchase on the app and received nothing. Then you contact support and it takes 24 hours for a response. I still havent received my purchase nor a refund and I was charged twice . Support just goes back and forth with you to extend the process. I figured that the game holds portions of your purchase so you dont win because its set up for you to lose. CONTACT ME I HAVE PICS

I have made several purchases in this game the past couple of days and this game constantly freezes anytime I try to advance to the next kingdom causing me to lose coins, 400 trail coins, several cookies and like 14,000 dice! I have advanced 20 levels in the past 2 days so this has happened a lot. I feel like this game should compensate my loses because this isnt right. However, I dont think I will be purchasing anything else from this game because of this issue. Fix the bugs!

game was really enjoyable. However, i came really close to completing an album and im using testerup to get rewards playing games. i would have received a 12 reward for completing album so i paid 15 knowing id get most of it back plus over 33k in game rolls due to completing tasks. After purchase the game glitched and kicked me off. i didnt have time after logging back in to complete the task, everything reset and i have now wasted 15. Do not bother wasting your money it will just rob you.

was a fun game but they ruin it with all the pop ups and worst of all every time u get close to being able to keep ur pet they start it over.  every so often they let u stay on ur pets level but steal all ur cookies so u have to start that level over. they never let u win enough to keep ur pet, even when u pay they make it almost impossible to win and keep your pets!

Glitches all the time, losing out on progress especially end of season and not getting the rewards youre due, especially when your a paid player! Sending receipts of purchases and still not getting full rewards, and they dont reply or help at end of season when your about to finish the album but dont, because you missed out on the rewards! waste of time!

0 stars me and my family were playing until we started to irregularities. like bonus bars not matching and the game literally offers bonus in tournament. when 1st seems good they will have a bot pass you within seconds of end of tournament when they go from 0 to 15000 even shows they cheat. Funny how game isnt even and fair for all. they pick and choose who wins not random. the dice rolls are predictable and same for trail spins all rigged to make you lose.

its just like a bunch of other dicetype games where you earn coins to purchase upgrades to buildings that others can attack. Small changes, one example this one has the Steal ability, but still like comparing granny Smith apples to golden delicious apples...

I have installed and reinstalled this game twice. First time I had this game I purchased several of packs and didnt received what was offered. Customer service thought giving me some dices and low lvl cards would help and clearly they dont understand what is fair. I took the game down and after a year I decided to give it one more try. Again, the game glitch and I lost my winnings and so far they are investigating... Did everything they told me to do and I still do not have anything. Beware

Love this game; Great to play especially when you dont want to sit around and wait for lunch to hit lunch time. Fantastic way to kill time fast, really it is.....so why are you still reading this message go ahead and download this game and give it a try. I bet you that youll give it a five star too! Not cause you like it but because youll enjoy it and youll be glad that i didnt lie to you like most of these apps that do! WOW What most of these companies do for people to try out their games.

This game is so unfair!! Unlike most games where with more dicecurrency you can achieve more in the game, this game sees that you have built up more dise and instead scales the milestones in order to force you to spend more dice. I dont know how you are supposed to actually get ahead in this game actually. I finally saved up over 14k dice and a new banner event started in which I needed to spend 1k points to hit the first milestone, previously the first milestone had always been 510 points.

I cant say anything bad about this game. I love this game, not too many ads. I play it all the time and it helps me to relax and go to sleep , but only thing is I keep losing my phone and having to start over. I just started out again . This is the best game ever and of the whole wide world. Its my time passer and to get out of my world. I love to get lost in this game. Hell its my favorite game to play on my phone. I can play forever and ever,I never want to stop playing Dice Dreamers.

Superplay are the worst when it comes to expensive purchases, very low value gameplay and rewards, very expensive pay to progress gameplay. There are so many popups it can take up to three minutes sometimes to load before you actually get into the game. Almost all their events are set up to lure you to the store and can only be completed if you make purchases. Just another heavily monetised game from Superplay that is set up to take your money while offering very little value in return.

the game itself can be fun, the problem is, its HIGHLY ADDICTIVE which is crazy considering your just rolling dice. But the biggest issue, you cant advance, you cant win challenges, nothing without buying packages from the game. they start out cheap and then they get increasingly expensive. If you manage to accumulate dice, the game will automatically set the amount of dice you roll exceptionally high and if you dont catch it, youll roll and lose all your dice. This game will cheat you!

The game is completely rigged. During the Halloween mission, I was at 199200 pumpkins to get 280 additional dice rolls. When I got to 200, the numbers automatically changed to 200210. Bad way to manipulate. Expecting us to pay for dice rolls by doing such thing is wrong and unethical. I have seen similar unethical methods used for domino dreams too. Unethical developers. Highly recommend not to support this game. PS: This is a rip off of Monopoly go. Recommend play that game instead.

at first I gave this app 5 stars but now after playing for a few weeks now I give it 2 stars not only do they take away watching ads for more dice the more u play but they also up the prices on rolls each time and also start charging tax and the higher ur purchases the more tax they charge it ridiculous. I have never played a game where they charge tax nor up they prices in the game. im starting to think that the developer of this game is money hungry.

Excellent game very fun. I used to be a Technical Director colorlighting on movies so I have deep appreciation for the work that goes into these games. Teamwork is essential to its success at launch and in ensuring its longevity. I have been playing for over a year now. DD is most definitely a hit. Gameplay is bound to become a habit. You dont have to buy playpacks to enjoy the game but play packs are very affordable. They are worth exploring to use hi multipliers to hit deadlines.

game itself is worth playing, plenty of things to collect or complete. but hands down one of the worst login experiences Ive had I any game. EVER. every login I have to close 1020 offers or event notices. and most of them you cant tap past, you have to exit them, wait a second, and THEN the next offer pops up. I avoid opening the game, and eventually stopped playing altogether because of this.

Ive been playing for abt a year  its one of my favs. I love all the different side events  games. They keep it exciting  interesting. Never boring  theres always new ones coming out, too. I do have a couple of critiques tho. 1st one being that I dont start w enough rolls  they regenerate way too slowly. 150 rolls is gone in less than 2 mins  then have to wait 10 hrs to be full. My other criticism is the coin amounts arent equal to the higher levels. Jst a cpl thngs 2 mayb consider.

This game has gone DOWNHILL fast.Being in a team now is a waste of time, it has been MONTHS without any Team Challenges to earn rewards,  they moved Teams location to a stupid place where its out of sight, so one can wait up to 3 DAYS before your teammates gift you rolls...PLUS their trails are rigged so the spins stay low  Terribly annoying and boring to play these days, so i seldom go on anymore. Would not recommend as game is currently not being maintained by Developers.

Progression is extremely and annoyingly slow, and theres not even ads to watch for more dice rolls or coins or nothin, so you cant speed it up without paying money. I saw another review saying theres ads to watch for rolls.. but I searched everywhere and theres none. At least for me, for whatever reason. Im playing from VYBS, theres a goal to complete Kingdom 6 in 3 days, Ive been playing for three days and havent even completed kingdom 2 because of how SLOW this is.

Fun Game! The only gripe is that some of the challenges cannot be completed without spending money.

it will reward you often and allow you to get through certain games easily but as soon as you make a purchase the difficulty goes through the roof. So when you think you will enjoy playing and winning awards but all that stops as soon as you have more to work with. example when I play for free with the rolls they give me I can move through obstacles fairly easily but I bought a package of thousands of dice rolls and now I cant get through any of these with out using thousands of rolls.

Ive been playing this game for at least 5 yrs. I used to love this game until recently. when ever you go to the part that you watch ads and you get rewards. You dont get the rewards. And the game starts over. At first I thought that it was the internet. it only happened about 20 times. But the last 2 weeks it does it Everytime. But I keep playing. Only after midnight. when you get coins and stuff. So if you fix that I will give you a 5 star again. Otherwise it will stay where it is.

my missing coupon. I used 800 points for a 10 dollar coupon and I never got it so I could purchase dice. no one will help me and I think its absolutely bs. you shouldnt offer coupons using points if you are not going to give the coupon. a very very unhappy pissed off religious player

I had enjoyed the game for the first little bit I played and then I unlocked tournaments, I won second on a tournament and got 800 dice. Which was fun to play through and I got a good couple levels through with the earns I got which then helped me win first on the next tournament. those rewards I never got. I emailed them a week ago and still havent gotten my earnings. Now I no longer have fun knowing I just get screwed out of my work and then asked fifty times to buy dice.

I really enjoy playing this game, there is so many different things to do and win prizes, the support is very good they always get right back to u, theres not ads except once in a while to get more dice but I dont mind watching a ad to get more dice. the game has great rewards, with so many options to play its really fun!! I just love getting big rewards with more dice!! Great game

A good game to play. But be a very careful. This game is filled of glitches and technical issues that takes spins in side games ( esp. in the trail side game) and dice rolls from you. Confirmed by the answers i get back from customer support of this game. They admitted it. Strong advice to all who play, DONT SPEND ANY MONEY ON UNTIL THESE ISSUES ARE FIX. IT TOOK 18 MONTHS TO RESPOND TO THIS BY YOUR SUPPORT TEAM. WHAT A JOKE.

love it, but Ive been ripped off... the game was great. Ive played for almost a year now but 2 days ago I made a 21 purchase  not only did it charge me twice but its now been 48 hours  i havent even recieved the items I purchased. I had a problem once before  had to reach out in game for support  it took 2 weeks for a reply, so im assuming it will take that long again. with the delay I missed the chance on getting my 6.2M coins. for the problems I gotta give it a 210.

this game sucks , dont waste your money on in app purchases to be told by support that your u post in game things to to an undetected version, that was downloaded through Google play and updated through Google play.. Raphael was rude and a jerk .. so it use to be a fun game. til you have so much B.S to deal with, them taking things away, glitches,not getting rewards.

had a technical issue  support cleared it up almost immediately! very thankful for that. i would give 5 stars but when you first open the app. It changes your dice to the max amount that can be rolled. it also shoves deals for the game in your face without clicking on them. which doesnt allow me to play as much as I want.

Noooo..This review has to do directly with their game. So by completing so many levels I had won about 100,000 rolls. When I was spending money to get my rolls, occasionally I was rolling to where I got FREE rolls (2 FREE dice). HOWEVER, as soon as I won all those rolls by completing the different levels and games, I went through all rolls and not a single time did the free dice roll. LOL.. to me thats shady, game manipulation, and customer  game player manipulation. A FAIR GAMEMY

Customer Support is slow to respond...sometimes weeks. They always say they dont see anything wrong. Very frustrating. Seems weekly updates to fix problems. Just creates new different ones. game is slow to respond sometimes and causes a loss of different things. pets, rolls, pet cookies. when you write to support...when they respond they tell you they didnt see a problem...send a screenshot. I would have to screen shot after every roll to capture the problem.

Ill give it 2 more business days. Despite reaching out via the app as well as instructed via email still no resolve despite being advised otherwise. Ive reported the matter to Google as I see many others have had to. Decades of using Google Play, this is a first. Buyers beware.

ever since the new update the game laggs. it freezes and shuts down and freezes my phone. I have to manually restart every time. Ive enjoyed this game for almost a year playing daily and spending countless dollars. unfortunately now I have to uninstall and delete the game because it is extremely unstable.

I love the game but I feel its a sham. You play the game and spend some money and all of the sudden the prices go up. You pay more for the same things. You pay 4.99 ,then the next week they want you to pay 9.99 but you get the exact same thing that you got for 4.99!!! Make That Make Sense

I used to love this app. Now it has cheated me out of my 3rd place spot prizes. Literally as of 8pm EST tonight. I won 3rd place in the Dream tournament and never received my prize which should have been 4 cards, 2.9k in dice and 460 million in coins. SCAM!!

uninstalled after clicking on the game and not even being able to click on the dice roll after 5.5 minutes of clicking on popups within the game I still couldnt get through. then it forced me to click on their link to direct to their Facebook group. when I went back into the game it blacked out. restarted the app, it restarted the popups. will not go through 100 popups in order to play a simple dice game that requires one button to push. uninstalled.

Its terrible, its not really a game you just push a button, no brain power needed. Theres a lot of push advert trying to get you to spend money on their game extentions. Absoltely no point because the game isnt a game its so borning. Only down loaded for to see if tye free cash app is legitimate, it is but this app advertises 0.11 each play!. It doest even pay you that, so seriously not worth wasting your time on this one. Just false advertisement.

The constant, irritating monetization attempts being crammed down my throat is too forceful. Now, these moneygrubbing attempts frequently cause the game to freeze and shut down. Plainly, this is not even slightly fun. Everyone involved should feel ashamed.

I enjoyed this game, but when I was supposed to receive a prize, I was notified of technical issues and never received the prize displayed on the screen. I reached out to customer service only for them to say they researched and didnt see an error and refused to rectify the situation. I regretfully must delete this game as I feel cheated. Im warning others so they dont have the same unfortunate experience. Bye Dice Dreams! Its been real

No matter if theres 10 minutes left or 8 hours. And they will get points like crazy making it nigh impossible for you to catch up. Please do yourself a favor and do not spend money or watch ads to support that scam.

was playing this via Prograd for cash rewards. Its a pretty fun game! I paid quite a bit of money via Google Pay to move through the levels and then Prograd flagged it for suspicious activity canceling my rewards. So of course, the game company gets my money and I get nothing. And I assume Prograd gets their cut too. Beware.

Very unfair that some players got access to ads in exchange of dices or steps on the trail. Why I dont have that? Why Im different? I was able to watch ads on the first day only. What has change then? Same phone, same wifi. The explanation of the developers is not real or true. I havent change anything and dont have ads anymore

Gotten boring! Game was fun, but the higher you go, the smaller the rewards get. Everything about the games is geared for you to spend money! You can watch endless videos to recharge, but usually, the dice rolls after are poor, so no point! Only play as its linked to another app!

The game is fine, but the popups are ridiculously excessive. I would say easily 50 of the time in the game is spent closing out popups. I dont mind an occasional one, but 68 in a row is too much.

Entertaining for a while but like 5 skill, rest is random luck dice generated. So you can just spam the roll button until you get a popup that takes 4 or 5 windows to close. Literally a 10min time suck til you run out of dice. The 4 more pop up windows to do stuff.
