My beautiful wife Teresa turned me on this game and we both love the game. Great setup, design and the graphics of each small games that are added on to earn the different ways to collect your sticker albums are very cool. My hats off to the computer graphics designers who put their hardwork and dedication to this game and one of the best games I have played on the android phone. Theres one problem, we was in the harvest race and 4 anvils was placed on my team. There should be a limit!

I love the game its fun, but the only problem is that when you get stickers, it doesnt give you new cards it repeats the card you already have if they were a way we can buy the cards that we need to finish the albums that would be cool and one more thing is there a way we can see what are friends have and or dont have when it comes to stickers for the album wait I have one more thing is there a way we can buy past shields dice and token to add to the collection

my rating is 4.5 stars out of 5 for this game, I play the game every day with my wife has been since the game came out loads of amazing changes they have done and fun mini games, but previous stick album for Halloween 2025 had on free parking a coin flip for more event points with new harry potter album this has been removed, also way too many golds and not enough gold trade events. I personally think last 3 days of album all golds should be tradable this would make it so much more enjoyable.

UPDATE CUSTOMER SERVICE SUCKS TO HELL!!! Putting up a banner of high call volumes does not excuse waiting over 1.5 hours for a response in a REAL TIME CHAT!!! People pay money in this game  thats unacceptable!!!! Wont get anger star until that is rectified QUICKLY!!! Reminds me of beloved missed Sorority Life except you dont build play houses with other player. The graphics are stunning and its a smooth playing game with others. Only took a week for me to get to level 20!!!!

update: The packs are too expensive. Maximum cost should be 510. A 50 pack is ridiculous. Need more chances at getting 4 star cards. Especially the white pack where you can swap. I like getting cards when I finish a board. I dont get the point of not being able to trade certain cards. Makes the game less fun. Ive played for couple years and have yet to complete a decks. Impossible. Encourage people to swap and give cards somehow.

I enjoy playin  interacting with other players to trade cards but its VERY ADDICTIVE  it should be less hassle than havin several apps  social media groups to go back  forth findin players to trade to complete album. its time consumin EVERY TIME u go n game u have to clear 46 popups sellin rollsstickers. the prices are based on how often u purchase. the more u buy higher the rate (different prices for exact same purchase)alot of scams  sketchy players thru out the game for sure

I would like to share my concerns about the recent difficulty of ingame events. Since the reduction of dice from 600 to 400, it has become much harder to complete events and collect stickers, especially for players who do not make ingame purchases. While I understand the game involves randomness, the current balance feels discouraging and less enjoyable. I hope the team will consider adjusting these changes to improve the overall player experience.

Super easy no brainer game and I love it! Graphics are nice and lots of different boards with games to fulfill to win more stuff. I REALLY wish we could communicate between players. Thats the reason why its just 4 stars. This way we can help each other for stickers or if someone wont be active, cause my community chess arent fulfilled at times because ppl stop playing. .

allreight game untill events hit you should have an option to kick a member of the team if thay dont play within a ammout of time unfair on thos putting the time into events if other team member that you randomly team up with dont even help so your stuck with loseing not really fair play on this game more pay to win or continue loses so for me app get a 2 star would of got more but just one stressful game that dont have any alternatives to help you

Fun game stickers kinda upset me. Ive put A LOT of money and time into trying to get stickers completed but those gold stickers have made me miss out on completing my collections by 1 sticker... several times. there should be a gold blitz day for every gold sticker. so at least everyone has a chance of being able to obtain each sticker. and not left completely up to a hope n prayer to get them.

Seems more glitchy the further I am in boards. Ive played for over a year now so Im pretty far along now. Update: it really seems to get worse with glitches and shutdowns the higher the boards you get. its very annoying. Reply: Theres no way to provide screenshots when you dont anticipate the need to showprove what happened. This last partner event was a joke! Any problems that are encountered are put off to screen delay. When its not. no screenshot no proof. PS the boards are neverending

pop ups are annoying, most events dont last long enough to finish our you dont get enough of whats needed to finish, but all the race events lasts 4 days. your friends should not sure up on yosit downs or bank heist but they do and all stickers should be able to trade all gold not just 2 and the flags or event tickets should given in amounts do you can use all of them, cant use 18 flags on race events. how about a back to the future or die hard events, I really want a DeLorean token.

love this game but I wish they would do at least 1 day, like the last day of the album, where we can get 10 gold sticker trades. Ive played a lot of the events and done really well, spent a lot of money and yet Ive only gotten 1 wild sticker, and its nearly impossible to get all the gold stickers from packs before the times up because 99 of the stickers are duplicates. The only time you can trade gold stickers are select days and you can only trade 2 specific stickers.

Its just not fun anymore. updated 12925 I started playing again and I ABSOLUTELY LOVE the new games that you guys have incorporated. However, although I understand you guys still need to make a profit, it seems as if you make it so that you HAVE to spend a ton of money to complete the albums. You should make special events where all gold is tradable for a limited time maybe 2 or 3 times a season because you dont do enough standalone gold trades right now as is. Something has to give.

very fun fast paced game made for short spurts or long play sessions. something for everyone here could you possibly add the feature of multiplying color wheel times the multiplayer you are currently playing at? when your at higher levels it gets hard to complete boards and color wheels dont do much anymore but if they multiplied times 10x 20x or 50x what you were playing at it would actually do something to help the player just a thought and something I noticed.

love it specially because I play with or against my family and friends. the only thing i dont like is that instead of giving me good deals, each time I check its more money less dice. its not worth it and it would be great if we can give away to friends when we finish competitions what ever we have left to help them out, Im almost on level 1,000 and Ive only finished once the sticker book its so complicated with the gold stickers it should be good to exchange any gold you want willingly.

great game but they are doing some nasty testing Behind the scene. my dice regeneration is frozen at 40hr and a net worth of over 20700 and yet a friend whose net worth is 5300 is getting increases now at 53HR so a difference of 300 per day this 2000 dice per wk. so major disadvantage to me. less shields. less rewards. lower ranking in express etc. customer service response. testing. developers need data. my feedback. great for newbie. awful for loyal fans.

Ive been playing since the game launched, I absolutely love the game. But it would be nice to finish the dang sticker sets more often, actually finished all 4 builds in partner events or complete a dig more. Only accomplished each 1 of these only once in 3 yrs. Its from lack of trying or spending a few dollars here and there! Over all great game, very addictive! P.S. Ball Carnival Game needs early retirement

Ive been playing this game since earlier this year. its now getting me annoyed with the racing part. I find the prizes not worth entering the race regardless if you come in 1st 2nd or 3rd. theres no way of saying you dont wish to participate in the race. it just basically forced you into it. this time I didnt select any partners and just let it play out. how about instead of collecting flags for nothing you give an option to opt out the race? or the flags you do collect trade them in dices

At first, its fun to play. As you progress through the game, its harder to complete maps because of constant attacks, even if you have shields. There are too many ads especially when you run out of dice rolls. Even if you spend, you will not complete sticker albums. If you have too many duplicates, you still wont get the stickers you need. The Quick Wins punish you if you miss a day or miss 1 of the 3 goals. Also, I feel the partner or other quests feel rigged. Dont get addicted to this.

I just need 1 gold sticker for the 3 time in the past 6 months and they just want me to pay for it and it was to many chances to get my stickers but thay never give it to me and is not fair to do 1 gold sticker exchange and have been chosen by one stupid person when should be 1 trade sticker chosen by player. you game dont deserve to spend time on it all its programming no scales at all. I wish if there is 0 star in the review.

Magical. No really. Harry Potter style witchcraft. Dont be scared lol. Come,pick a house. Roll your way to riches and fame. Gotta go.Race starts soon and I want those sticker packs. I do need to add that the game would be a lot better if we could give or trade the Golden stickers that we have rather than waiting until certain times or being restricted to which ones are available to gift or trade.

I would have given this game 5 but to me they dont understand why we complain it was enjoyable to kill some time to get stickers to finish your albums but when the game expects you to waste dice for getting more points for more dice its wrong in also the little side events you dont get enough items to finish the little events in time also the golden stickers shouldnt be all about a blitz they need to make it fairly for everyone as you can see in every album they was more 4 stickers than 5

so I would give 5 stars because I actually dont play games but my friends got me into this and I really enjoy it during my free time. the reason I took away a star is because this game lies.. my friend stole some money from me in a heist, but nowhere near the amount it is telling me she stole .. its saying she stole 57million from me, meanwhile she showed me, and she only has 18k.. so she only got 18k, and meanwhile I lost 57 million ? hows that make sense..? wish I could load screenshots

Ive never finished a sticker pack. The game isnt fair. I get so pissed that I waste my rolls to get a green and gold pack when I have over 100 one star sticker same with the 2 stars. I DONT NEED ANYMORE OF THEM. Im struggling to get 4 star stickers. Which never seems to happen. The game isnt fair In my purple pack on Sunday I got one new 5 star and 5 1 stars like I need those 1s. I just wish mogo would play fair. I get the SAME stickers all the time. Give me 4 or 5 even 6 stars.

Oh my god i didnt think I would get a response lol, to your reply however my views have somewhat changed, I like the game however I think you should work more closely with testurup, I think the game is cool, however I think there should be more rewards for in game purchases, and I think you could make the game a little faster with more financial rewards. Do you have an email for your development department where I can email to provide more constructive feedback? btw I reinstalled the game .

Unfortunately I have to agree with some of the more negative reviews regarding Monopoly Go. You will rarely (if ever) finish events or a sticker album without paying. Even when you do purchase items, you are not guaranteed to. Purchasing a pack with a sticker in, and not knowing what you will get is the definition of gambling. This needs investigating and regulating. By all means play for free and have some harmless fun, but under no circumstances should you purchase anything in this game!

I have been playing this game for a couple of years now. It has been a great game to play up until a few months ago and it keeps getting worse! About every 3 weeks I have to UPDATE it before I can continue to play, after doing so, I cannot get back into the game until the next day. It loads up to 98 and it hangs there! It has caused me to loose spins and now flags in this race event. I would of given 5 stars but it continues to get worse. I cannot enjoy a game that I cannot get back into!!

I advanced in this game so fast without spending money, the limited my play. When I asked them about it, they said I got far in the levels without spending real money so they decreased my dice cap. theyre pathetic. update at developer response: lol at their BS response trying to gaslight me. I reached out to their customer service and claimed it was an trial test and theyre making changes to limit to amount of max rolls. I dont need to troubleshoot. Monopoly Go need to do scamming people.

I like the game its fun and entertaining but there are pros and cons with all things. Cons I dont like how they wont let you continue to play unless you update it. I just updated it last week 12925. Today is only the 17th. If the app has that many issues I dont need it. One update a month is more than enough. why refuse me access because I dont want multiple updates weekly .

done w this game. Cant complete anything. They blocked ppls account with a clone account for cheating but yet ppl pay a website to purchase a slot for the racing event and those ppl will win so if monopoly is going to ban those with a clone account then they need to do away with the races. Im just done with game. They want you to pay all this money so u can complete. They let you get so close and hope u pay to complete. Its time to move on from this. not fun anymore.

Its fun, but I fill like the game can be controlled to get you to purchase dice and I have made purchases and then the game has screwed up and I lost the dice I purchased. Also I think can control if you finish events and sticker albums. They make it impossible to complete them. Ive only completed one event in 2 years and I have never completed un sticker album

I love the community. the game is fun, but be warned: its a cash grab. You cant win events wo spending . If you do, you get nothing cool in return. I.e., last season, getting to Monopoly class 4 on the train awarded zilch. Most of the class upgrades came with nothing tangible (dice, emotes, game pieces, or shields). The sticker album is impossible: 2200 stars of dupes, yet still short 3 untradable gold stickers. Digital prizes cost nothing to give, so why be so miserly with them?

Worse than gambling. Fun, and the little minievents are cute... but you cant win anything anymore without spending at least 40. Even then, when you have 23 different events going on, you can go through 1,400 ROLLS (I stay at a multiplyer of x20) and land on NOTHING. This has been my problem for 2 WEEKS NOW. The rewards suck after you hit level 100. The reward chests arent that great anymore, at least they dont upgrade when you do. I want to delete the game now. No longer fun.

Wheres tycoon club gone 2nd time this has happened, all options to get it back dont work. Need an option too to be able to change partners who want you to accept them as a partner then they dont play. Should be able to in vite someone who wants to play, otherwise you just playing on your own, no chance of finishing anything, and the more things you to roll the wheel the smaller the values the wheel lands on, rip off

Love the old Monopoly board game? Youll love this. The creators did a great job translating the original game into a mobile game, showing that its themes have only grown more relevant with time. How they do pvp is clever (which is good, because it isnt optional): you steal money from other players, but only from ones way richer than you who most likely wont notice whats gone. I sure dont. Great commentary there. Ad assault is the main downside. As well as slower progress if unpaid.

Great, until they changed the rules without notice. I have been enjoying this game for months and have been diligently building up my rewards. when suddenly overnight the game cut my hourly regeneration in half and took over 200 rolls from my Max allotment from me without any notice. it seems like the game thought I was doing too well so I felt it needed to punish me. I made it seem like a system update. overall still enjoy the game. however, this recent adjustment has made the game less fun.

I agree with the comments. The game can be fun  quite addicting, but Ive noticed some sketchiness within the game. Also, I hate spending unnecessary money over some damn dices to get ahead. If theres one thing I would change, its the option to choose opponent on a heist like you do with a landmark.

love the game but dont get a lot of things. I am higher level then others and played longer but I am on 400 dice and my girlfriend who is 100 behind has 1000 rolls. it glitches when you play games like racers and food and Peggy. itll act like its stopping on a high number then glitches and continues to spin. Peggy ugh dont get me started. the new games like battleship and circle boards are awesome! Th3 response doesnt make sense. so play as much as you want but you wont necessarily grow.

Ever notice you miss the prize by just a little? that is on purpose! This game uses predatory monetization, where algorithms analyze your playstyle, session length, and spending history to adjust your luck factor. From there, they collect the most money before you grow bored and stop playing (Billions, actually). Everyone should report to Google (in the Play Store), and the FTC: ftc.govcomplaint. Scopely is clearly engaged in deceptive practices, they just havent been investigated.

Love this game, its so dim to play with your Facebook friends and complete strangers and building whatever needs to be build and then crashing the other players building and robbing them. I love the race, getting stickers and so much more. the downfall is the community chess, at first it was great how you have to click on a button and people that was selected that helped you in there and you and the person get either money or dice, but now these community chest task sucks and then you waiting.

I love this game. Just would like to make a suggestion. The pairing with the racers on racing game is horrible, you are paired with racers that dont race at all. Can you please make this where you can pull out of a race when this happens. The team I have right now suck they not playing I have tried to search on a way to take myself out of this race, it only has this option in the beginning of the race.

Cant win an album collection reward because you have to pay to win. I started counting the rolls and spaces and it doesnt add up. I would be on a railroad, roll a 5, but stop one space shy of the corner space or one space ahead. Customer service says its a game of chance, but thats clear cheating. And it seems like if you contact customer, they screw with your account. This game used to be fun until they started screwing people over. I refuse to play a game developed by scammers and liars.

probably one thing that needs to change is the loading screens and popup for milestone and opening packs, its just 1 seems to take few seconds bit when you have like 5 to 6 pop ups its just takes really to long. for the reward pops up because your also getting too many so the game is almost longer on just videos then playing the game itself. it doesnt need a animation after opening 40th pack. it needs to be shorter video animation

The biggest problem i have is that I waste hundreds of rolls trying to complete a bank heist or hit community chest. today I had 1700 rolls and was doing x10 and now I have 800, have only hit a railroad 3 times and all of them were shutdowns. that seems very unfair when it comes to completing daily tasks. Update: I have had people bank heist me for 803 million and 626 million. how is that fair? I only had that happen once and it was recently. how are people regularly hitting me for big numbers?

I was addicted to Monopoly. 2 months ago I had 45k dice by playing fairly, I am down to 9k dice with 11 days to go and 20 stickers to collect. I played consistently. People are def cheating their way through the game. Its virtually impossible to complete 1 album. There are no fair trades. I am ready to uninstall this game. The 2 star rating is because of the mini games, love battleship, the most fair game in Monopoly Go, and other star because its a free game.

It was getting better with lower prices for more dice, but they have added a lot more golden stickers to get and its nearly impossible to collect all of them. They need to give us the choice which golden stickers to ask for. Also, the most frustrating issue is the change in the dice. I was at 400 dice, then it was changed to automatically collect 1000 dice, and its now back down to 500. No warning either! The back and forth makes me not want to play anymore! No more buying dice now.

I wish I could rate 0. Constantly bombards you with upgrade packs to buy. Takes forever to progress. If you buy a pack they change the deal for the remaining packs to screw you. Icing on the cake is they just reduced everyones total dice. I went from 600 down to 300. Uninstalling this scamming app. EDIT: To make things clear ALL of your progress is at the whim of greedy developers. Nearly 3 months of gameplay and progress only for it to be sneakily cut in half over night. Dont give them a cent

This game is a scam. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND DEFINITELY NOT YOUR MONEY! They say packs and dice rolls are random but theyre not. Everything in this game is rigged to get you to spend money to finish events and the album. Oh you need 2 more stickers to finish your album and get the big reward? Too bad were not going to give you either of them from packs for weeks, but as soon as you finish an event and get a sticker selector youll pack it in the very next pack you open making it worthless.

Im gonna be brutally honest with my review. When I first started this game I was having a blast. I kept wanting to log in to roll my dice. I even put in over 50 to make my playing experience better. I won a few of the daily tournaments which felt super rewarding. Then the reality set in. I was only ever getting account progress when I bought dice for real money. Im stuck with a terrible 150 dice cap that gets me no where. I would need to buy dice to even have a chance to win the daily event.

Every part of this game works fine, theres nothing that doesnt work, and no notably glaring glitches. The problem is gameplay, and the game purpose, which is seasonal albums, and events. Ive now played 3 seasons, and every time its the same thing, the entire community complaining that you cant finish albums, or seasonal events, due to broken minigames and events. Top bar? Thatll be 1,300pts, 20pts every 10 rolls, maybe. Finish an album? Pay 50 for wilds, or find yourself gold locked.

I got through the first three cities before deleting. Its VERY on rails. Even the showdown event (landing on railroads) is pointless. Doesnt matter what one you choose, you always win the same amount. The Heist game is rigged 100. No variation in game play. It is fun for a while until you run out of rolls.... then either pay or wait a long time to refill. Two bonus are that there are no adverts at all and graphics are nice.

only way to advance is spend money, the game is rigged in the matrix of the system. I started playing 3 years ago and have watched them add more and more things that only way to get was to pay a lot of money and I mean like 1ks of dollars. with out money spent you will never finish the sticker collection, win one of the races as a team, of finish any side games. do not waist your time.

The game is fun but there are issues with the weekly quick wins reward(the sticker pack) just not being rewarded to the player and all of my board rewards got suddenly reworked to be 100 points away instead of 2550, so now I have way less rewards than I did yesterday including board rewards, roll regeneration, etc. Not sure what kind of update completely reworks the way the game is setup without any alerts to the player but very off putting. Not worth the optional payments you have to make.

I have been playing this game for awhile now, and it seems like all these games cater to people who pay the inapp purchases. I also think that certain things should be limited on certain modes of the game. For example, the anchors, you can put unlimited amount of anchors on opponents if all four of your players get one. I think personally that is unfair, cause not all people use in game purchases. My fiance and I dont use them cause we think it is a waste of money. I think it needs to change.

Good time waster every handful of hours each day. Definitely a game that rewards playing daily for long periods of time. The more time youve put in, the better your rolls and rewards get. The game has a lot of RNG so dont expect to control whats happening all the time, there are ways to be smart about how you use your rolls, and other resources. it is very mtx heavy, you will get deal and dice popups each time you run out of rolls, but you can play without spending anything.

I DID love this game until they made it IMPOSSIBLE to complete albums. The ungodly amount of duplicates is ridiculous. If this game is to be top notch, fix that issue. I get youre not gonna get them in every single sticker pack, but getting down to the last albums which are harder to complete, the amount of duplicates need to be considerably reduced. Not being able to at least finish albums without spending a ton of money makes this very irritating and unenjoyable to play.

Its fun: With soundscolors and occasional themes (like star wars and Harry Potter) Simple: The concept is really easy, 1 button to push... Connection: you can play w friends and family and its fun. Cons. Addictive: gives casino vibes (dice  spins) Value: store  deals are expensive... Commitment: if you genuinely want to go far you have to spend quite a bit of money...

The main game is great, but the minigames are frustrating. Some go so fast, as in the game is only around for like 2436 hours, which is stupid. Who has time to earn enough picks to dig or coins to play plinko and get anywhere real in the game? On the other end, the races and building ones last forever but they require a partner or team but without friends IRL they NEVER find a match up until game 2 or 3 of the race or never for the buildup, and that has no play solo option either.

Im not happy with the game customers service. They are very rude.i ask to recover my account. The one Im using I had to make because I couldnt retrieve my email from broken phone. They said I should be happy with the game I have. I cant have to games on same device. Thats fine but I should still have the option to pick the correct profile. I can give my daughter this game because its under her account. She can put this one on her account on her phone not two on mins

I play this game everyday, however, I wish there was a way for friends to be able to converse with one another, or even being able to have a way for friends to be able to see a specific sticker youre looking for. Only having 1 sticker request a day makes it really hard to be able to complete the albums. I feel like this would be really effective in helping a lot of people out.

So far , its very relaxing and fun, without intrusive ads. I play it for my relaxation , even tho im still at a low level. I hope it processes as that (without many ads, only if i choose to). The cities and the buildings you build to get your cash are very cute and i love how it basically shows you how to play real life monopoly the correct way!

The only reason for 4 instead of 5 is because this game you cant choose who you attack until level 55. I keep hitting the same people all the time. They must be thinking Im hitting them on purpose. The game made me hit one person over 5 times. Could you please put a button in the game to choose another person to attack if you have already hit them? Other than this, its a great game. Im really enjoying it. Even trying to get a signal in work just to play for a few minutes. Thank you

The reason for only 2stars is they randomly reduced the dice capacity from 600 to 500 overnight without any warning or explanation in game. The capacity was earned via the net worth rewards. When I asked the customer service via in game I was given a cookie cutter response from the agent without actually answering why this had changed  they ended the chat without allowing follow up. This experience has tarnished overall experience of the game and will make me reconsider spending any more money

it was fun for awhile, but several things have happened that make it not fun at all. I had my dice max cut from 860 to 400 and my dice per hour cut from 106 to 41. More than a 50 drop with no explanation and no compensation for all the net worth cards that now show I got nothing for them. In the newest game there is supposedly some rewards and riddles you are supposed to be able to access depending on which house you chose, but I havent gotten any. Cant get enough dice to do much of anything

I am in several groups with hundreds of people, the game is greedy customer service sucks, DO NOT EVER SPEND MONEY! I HAVE NOT COMPLETED AN ALBUM IN ALMOST A YEAR. Thats with daily game play, completing all task side events and main events and participating in every single event or trading opportunity. They keep you a card, 2 cards short, then just before the album ends they supply FIFTY DOLLAR wild cards for you to buy to complete the album. TELL ME AGAIN ITS NOT ABOUT MONEY!

Ive had so much fun with this game, I think after half a year of playing it Im almost at 4,000. Ive only had one problem, lag. I thought it couldnt get worse, but after I hit 3,000 it started kicking me out of the game. Luckily, if Im kicked out just as Im getting rewards I usually get them when I come back. I think Im at board 115 and the grind is getting much harder, the sticker events are fun, and I love the racing events. But please fix this part where it kicks me out.

Players are tired of the card trade limits. If we spend over 20, we should get new cards. Partners events should guarantee a new card by Safe 3. Themes take too longgive us something like Harry Potter already! Also remove the Gold card lock; we should choose our own. We spend money, but the rewards dont match. The game is getting boringplease do better.

The game will remove rewards and your dice capacity randomly and gaslight you into believing it never happened. I wrote customer service and they claim that this was part of testing and that dice capacity was affected. I never opted in to be in a test group and my capacity went from 430 to 200. The game itself is fun when its not glitching or trying to sell you on different things. My friends will have the same promotion but completely different pricing! Dont purchase anything in game

Just from experiencing the game,  reviewing reviews, I have to say theyre very accurate. Even my friends in real life that used to play the game (from Facebook) stopped playing it as well, its a sign that the game is fun at first until the whole concept ruins it, its supposed to be fun with others competitively, yes. But whenever its just  spammed in your face as well as difficult challenges, prompts more spending or quitting, honestly I already spent about 6,  willingly to leave. :(

Feeling conned. I had my dice limit up to 800, I log on a few days ago, and its back to 500. Which would be fine, if I didnt earn those extra dice limits by getting a higher net worth. So why exactly were they on the rewards for net worth if youre just gonna take them back? What do I get instead? Because it should be either an increase in money when I cross GO or an increase to payout when attacking or doing a bank heist. getting nothing when I earned them is wrong

UPDATE TO SCOPELY 2: Yes, you can play free. Its so defeating and not enjoyable to NEVER complete enough events for the wilds and switch packets. New update: I just used 2000 dice, 20 at a time, and couldnt hit a railroad for 1 of my quick wins. Im out of dice and youve start a new event. I cant get past the 4th or 5th level unless I buy dice. theres 20 levels for a wild. I know you gotta make money but, I cant even do quick wins. its pathetic scam.

I used to really enjoy this game when I first started playing it. The longer Ive been playing, the less fun but more frustration I have been having. I refuse to spend money on a game that makes me feel like I HAVE to spend money. This game definitely now feels like I need to spend money just to get stickers, new shields, new dice, etc. I have yet to get a new set of dice. I never get to complete sticker packs or events because of low rolls I have more to say but not enough characters to say it.

almost impossible if not impossible to complete albums without spending money. also clarify the rules for the new games you incorporate the original racing game gives you rockets  you can stack them. this one gives you brooms but you cant stack them? my whole team minus 1 person already had a broom so my partners wasted a whole prize box on 1 out of 4 team mates to get a broom. he contacted customer service and theyll add it to the notes. Thanks, that helped a lot. mean while I lost 2 broom

MGO need to do better by their players that actually play fair every day. Cheaters finish off weeks prior and multiple times over yet theres nothing but disappointment for loyal and fair players. Im going to play the Harry Potter event but if I dont finish I will pull free permanently, I have played for a few years and only finished twice and that was because a cheating player came on the scene but I wanted to see if it was possible to actually finish without paying money, turns out no.

It has the potential to be a great game. But, they roll out updates to select people first which gives them advantages in the game while you are left with nothing. I have been playing for years and I got all my friends to join. All of them got an update where they get 1000 rolls. Theyve had it for months now so its not a test. Ive asked when mine will be updated and all I get is soon. I have lost the last 4 albums because Im not getting the same updates. All they want is your money. 05.

But Ive never been able to complete album.

a few glitches and too many 1 and two star stickers. no one wants to trade stickers and if the do you have to give 10 to 15 times what its worth. That takes the fun out of the game.

I honestly wish there was a way to give less then one start cause this game needs it. the prizes for events are getting worse and worse. the probabilities are heavily in favor of the game. its obvious that they basically force you to spend money on a free game. it kills a few minutes of the day ht will never be anything more then that. less ads after all your rolls are out plz.

After playing daily for over a year and spending way to much on this game, I saw that my hardearned roll capacity and dice count was cut down significantly (more the 50). I reached out to customer service and was told that the diceroll capacity was just an experiment (one I didnt know I was part of) and that because the test had ended, theyd taken all my progress away and were not able to fix it or set it back. If you take away my insensitive to play, I no longer need to play. Delete.

I can understand how this game has had a revenue of over 5bn. Its addictive, fun,  frustrating. Was a whale for a week, but have decided to uninstall as of today, as paying  gives you no competitive edge  Id say in fact it does the opposite. Im not going to feed the beast any more. Was fun, though, while it lasted. Great that theres no direct ingame adverts, only subtle brand partnerships in their sticker collections, etc. It was the first mobile game Ive played, and the last.

I have loved the game and played it diligently for a while. In the beginning you do win if you play continuously but as you progress it becomes harder to complete the in games , collect all stickers, get more rolls without spending money. A lot of times you reach very close but dont winget the prize. This makes me feel the game is rigged. But not complaining as the game has no unnecessary ads.

I rated it a four star instead 5 because of these reasons 1.dice is very limited and we only get 56 dices per hour which makes it hard to continue the game. 2.the stickers are hard to collect especially the gold ones.Imagine you only have a few days left to get them and you have not still get them which makes it very grindy. overall:this game is still good but makes it hard to grind because of the limited dices and also stickers are hard to collect.

When your roll capacity goes from 810 to 410 overnight and your roll regeneration is cut in half after working too boost both, their response was too bad... deal with it!!

Had this at five stars for a while, but dropping it all the way to one. Why are we advertising the franchise of a bigot and dedicating a whole season to it? And the Racers event is a joke  it also seems like if you dont spend any money, you have a snowballs chance in Hell of completing your entire album or winning any of the events or tournaments anymore. Yall realize most people dont have the discretionary funds to do that, right? And it erases the fun of playing your game? Do better.

rug pull. the team at Monopoly Go did a Test to see if an increase in roll cap and regeneration (energy and amount of time youre allowed to play for most games), auto including new players to the game then reverting back to the slower regen and smaller caps causing those hooked on those dopamine loops to then feel frustrated in the game. this will cause more vulnerable players with less impulse control to overspend on this cheap cash grab.

Was fantastic until my roll regeneration went down, then yall fixed it after a month went back up to 1000 bank and 100 rolls per hour. I was spending HOURS on this game, and buy dice packs to help get things to collect because I had a reason to. Now theres not enough to see a point, AND Im really upset they did this during the Harry Potter Release. Bring back the extra rolls and the extra roll regeneration.

Overall, fun to play in the Moment, just ignore the urge to return to play more than once daily. I played this Game for close to two months excellent festive seasonal themes, biggest frustration is the excessive lagging animations during timed rewards. And after playing atleast once daily every day the sticker album frequency of new stickers fell short about twenty stickers, and stricker trades are a bit frustrating.

Entertaining but cluttered. I enjoy the game, however each time I open the app I have to click through several available purchases. This carries onto the screen, where the left side is littered with them. I would like to hide these. I enjoy playing the game at the pace it was designed, and dont have plans to purchase any of these. As there are no ads I understand why these are pushed so heavily, however some days they feel so pressuring I just get off the game.

The game used to be fun. But in the last 3 weeks, the game has literally nit had me land on reward tiles. when a new event starts, I have had thousands of dice and not landed on railroads or the other in games reward tiles. I dont get anything over a pink pack of cards anymore. Every time I exit the game lately, I come back and see billions and billions gone. Before 3 weeks ago money wasnt gone like it is now. just simply Taking the fun out of it.

Uninstalling after a little over a year cause the game felt like a chore. If you played World of Warcraft its like they took the dailies and made them their own game. If there was more to do when I was rolling I might have stuck around, the fair games are at least fun but everything else is RNG and that can only be so fun for so long. If you need the occasional time killer this will do.

Intentionally designed to be addictive on a gambling level. Monopoly Go is pay to win and they price discriminate. Customer service will tell you everything is random, nothing is rigged (which is an obvious lie) and they use its a test as excuses. You can play for free but youll almost never complete a sticker album because of the goldlocked stickers and youll probably never win or complete any event unless you buy dice or cheat. Too many buy me popups. Too many glitches.

Started off as a great game a long time ago, fast and funny, with lots of different themes, including the Fantastic Four, Halloween some team play. Now its become dull. How the current Harry Potter theme is supposed to be part of Christmas or happy holidays or any religious celebration, I do not know. It seems like the programme developers have stopped caring. If thats the case, then why do they expect us to care? Have they just made enough money and switched off? Sad.

So Ill start by saying that initially I thoroughly enjoyed this game. I had a significant amount of fun playing it. But as I have ventured farther and farther into the game theres a lot of things that are starting to rub me the wrong way. Firstly there was the revelation of the significant discrepancies and inconsistencies between the cost of dice packages solely dependent upon the person buying them. But then to add to that it seems to me there are a lot of slights and manipulations that seem

The funniest game that others cant even ruin finally. However, there are ways people can be sure losers and hog things. Its still fun. There are ways people or games are cheating, but a lot in other games. More people are figuring out how to cheat now too. The original jungle carnival was fun but now its harder than that way too. Its hurting the fun too. Still addicting. The cheaters officially found the game. the cheaters officially found the way to ruin the fun out of the game!

I enjoyed this game for the most part. However, it is NOT a monopoly game. It really just uses the assests and IP to make a weird game, mostly about different types of gambling. Downsides: lots of in game popups trying to get you to spend money of rolls or event attempts. If you want to do well in said events you must spend money. Now recently theyve done a crossover event with Harry Potter. I was already on the fence of dropping the app, that really just made it easier for me.

I like the app, mostly for the art. But today I noticed my roll capacity had quietly been cut down from 800 something to 500, and my hourly rolls were reduced from 80 something to 50. Since Im at a pretty high level at this point that really impedes my ability to progress further. Seems like a blatant way to try and get more money out of me

after almost 2 years, its fun just dont expect to finish the album unless you spend money. even if you log in everyday you will see the same stickers you have got 3x or more. ( gee thanks) even when you log in everyday and do the dailys you will get the exact same stickers you have always gotten. you gotta pay to finish the month album! they dont do this for free. get rid of the UNlucky coin flip, it just makes us non buyers mad.

I have to rate one star to get the attention of free to play players. Scopely has removed most of their family friendly f2p rewards. the game is heavily centered around pay to win players especially during events. Ive been grinding regularly, even losing sleep to steadily try and claim the Luna love good shield but its all for nought. Scopely no longer cares for free to play players and you should know this going into the game. the devs only care for greed. They must ALLOW you to win.

Fun in the beginning but has become unbearable to play anymore. Impossible to finish albums when you get the same stickers over and over and over. Dwindling rewards followed by greater expectations to complete events. Youre always one square away from the one you need. Constantly bombarded with screens to purchase things with real money asking for laughable prices. It seriously cost the developer that much to create a wild sticker to have to sell it for 80! Pay to play is the motto.

I enjoy playing MONOPOLY GO alot and have been playing 23 years now, but it can be costly if you really want to advance in the game unfortunately not all can afford. I understand the costs as the game was created to earn a profit Im sure. players can enjoy playing free. personally Im too impatient and have too much free time. Players can search outside the game to find friends, game strategies and explanations to different aspects in many social apps .

I have been playing game since it came out. The game is not fun anymore. the race has cheaters and they do nothing about. I would recommend not playing this game at all its hard and you end up spending to much money its not even worth it. Very addictive They make changes to the game without telling you. this game is a waste of money and time. You ask customer service for help and they just want to argue with you about how wrong you are when you are not and you get cheated out of dice on glitches

Ive been playing everyday for the three years , paid for some dice, and still havent won the sticker collection prize. The new flip coin is a joke, out of 62 times landing on it, only 2 times completing it. They rig the game so you have to buy more dice, even then you cant win.

Starts out real fun, but its addicting, and not healthy. DO NOT PLAY! Scopley is so busy micromanaging the players, how well,or how bad you do. Scopley always uses the stand by its our algorithms as if they dont program the algorithm! They say we want it to be fair for everyone well is it fair they charge me twice as much for dice than the guy down the road? NO its not! The only way Ive ever completed an album is putting at LEAST 100 into the game during the season. Customer service AWFUL!

Really good game and they did a nice job with the different events and prizes. I think Im close to board 300. My advice is do not spend any of your money on a free game with no material prizes to win. What would you be paying for? My experience is you can go just as far in the game without spending a dime. Only problem I have with the game is when it does glitch, which is seldom, you can lose random rewards or money gained. Customer Service is horribly long most times if you have an issue.

Do they know its Christmas at Scopely? Just a random question cos it sure doesnt look like they do. Nothing on a board remotely like it. Been with the game from Day 1, despite all the incorrect Dice rolls (like rolling a 12, dice moves 7) on hundreds (no exaggeration) of occasions. Being cheated  forced to repurchase Landmarks (despite screenshots proving otherwise). NEVER, I mean never completing a Sticker album. Maybe 23 times winning an event at most in these 3 years. 2026 is bye bye.

Edit to address the developer response: You say youre working on streamlining, but the solution is already there. Every sale you pop up is already pinned to a button on the left side of the screen. Just stop the autopops. If I want to buy something, I know where the buttons are. Also, stop the out of dice popup when I actually still have dice left but am just at a higher multiplier.

I would strongly advise you not to install this game! played for several years. MOGO is all about getting you to buy dice to advance your game. The game seems rigged to slow your progress down. they added more golden stickers to ensure you never complete an album it has been over a year since I won! The daily awards are pathetic!

This game is annoying. Scammers are not reprimanded. Some games or events are frustrating and beyond attainable unless u buy dice from them. The race game ever since they brought the chain in April 2025, its the most frustrating. The Community chest, It doesnt matter if you maxed. You only get one red card. When it first came out you used to get 2 or 3 now always 1. When I first started playing.I was able to finish the album now.Four or five albums later NOTHING!!!! DONT BOTHER!!!

I cant remember ever making a review but I feel this needs attention. Supposedly there was an ingame test involving increased roll capacity, never knew about this. Now in the middle of an event they dropped the roll capacity. You earn roll capacity as an ingame lvl up. They didnt even balance the lvls out for the loss of rolls. So lvl stayed the same but lost rolls and got nothing in return. Significant loss of time.

Theres nothing lucky about the Lucky Coin, get rid of it. Properly match players for race events instead of pitting someone who doesnt spend money in the game vs someone who does. Stop with the duplicate stickers  chill with the micro transactions. I swear if more game developers were transparent in their intention to make money off of a game instead of pretending theyre in it for the love of gaming, more consumers would respect them. We wouldnt play your game but wed respect your honesty.

this game was much more fun a few years ago when I played it for the first time. there used to be free rolls available on Facebook to be able to keep going. now, this game is just a money grab and like other reviewers stated, not a few dollars here and there but huge sums of money. the rewards during events used to be large enough to blow through many levels, but they seem to have minimized the rolls and money earned in events as well as making the goalposts farther away and harder to hit.

Increadibly cute take on the idle game genre with a monopoly coat of paint. EDIT: Have to adapt my review because of the ABSOLUTELY obnoxious begging for money. Whenever you land on the main screen you are prompted for EVERY SINGLE OFFERING, one popup each. They are 5 or 6 now and it takes about 10 seconds just to click all of them away.

The game can be completely played without spending a dime and there are plenty of good things about it. I did play it for a while and I enjoyed it for what it was. You dont really get the Monopoly game out of this as you werent playing against other people but it is based on the Monopoly board and this is an interesting interpretation of the game to be played electronically. I wouldnt mind recommending this if youre looking for something that can be played without money.

I was getting more dice 100 an hour until yesterday when they dropped it to 50 for no reason or warning. both my son and I are ready to uninstall it because its not worth it unless you pay money and I will never do that...my bills and daily life are more important.

My son invited me to play this game. At first it was fun. we traded stickers and joined together for teams. However... we started comparing our screens. We quickly noticed we were being offered different prices and other unfair components. Im now way further along than him (both stars  completed islands) but my roll count is at 400, his is 800. I play more and spend money occasionally yet he has better features and cheaper prices. Unfair to players but makes the company more money

This has nothing to do with the original Monopoly. Still, I thought of checking it out in case its good; so I opened the app and it stuck on invite friends for some stupid event I have no interest of. Since youre so pushy to be promoted for free, youll get one little star, Ill downvote all those bot farms giving you 5 stars and Ill just uninstall it. And why do you have no google play login? Is it because your game is so scammy that too many were asking for refunds?

when trading stickers, you have to wait 16 hours for the others response. I think a helpful way for the user to send the sticker could cancel that transaction in case they have a better sticker proposal but cant perform it without the sticker. thats being held for 16 hours.

update: tech support helped get it working again, so adding more stars. Minus 1 star for all the pop ups for microtransactions. The game did an update and now it wont load. It will sit at the loading screen at 100 and never open. If you close it out, it wants you to do the steps to download the update all over again.

So I dont even leave reviews but I had to step in here. I will start by saying this is actually a good game minus a few annoying mini games that I skip but overall really solid. The reason I am only giving 3 stars is I am honestly shocked at how bad the algorithm is. I will literally have 1000 dice and land on nothing of importance. It is legitimately impossible to win at anything without spending the money. I have even spent money once just to see what would happen and my purchase was a waste.

The game is no longer fun, predetermined landings and rolls. Sometimes rewards are low for the amount of dice you burned. Duplicate stickers even for tournaments, either one star duplicates or golds that are useless for trading. Do not recommend this game to people going through tough times. I wish there were negative reviews. Id give it a solid NEG. THUMBS DOWN

This developer acts really shady when it comes to game glitches and are seriously not willing to give the missing dice when albums are completed even when you find out how many dice you had at logout and how many you have at ligin the computers says albums was completed on different time frames than was actually completed.

I dont know if anybody at scopeley has already thought about something like this, but Im sure theres a few other players that feel the same way.

Monopoly is such a stressful game, is just a waste of time and effort, you can play and play, and will never get gold stickers, unless u get a wild card by playing a game which requires alot of dices. For a race game which has a chain it takes so many dices to remove a chain and then dices, u need to stay awake up to 3am to complete. sometimes you are just few points to win certain games and you will have no choice but to purchase the dices. The game has made me so stressed and kept me awake.

Im changing it to 3 stars because I found a glitch. and its happened a few times. its regarding quick wins. Here is the glitch: pass go 2x. I roll with a 2x multiplier, my token passes go and it lands me on a railroad to shutdown a landmark. I cant pause the game to see what the next quick win is, so Im forced to do the action. I shut down the landmark. my next action is to shutdown a landmark which I just did. so now I have to lose dice rolls until I get a shut down again. please fix this!

been playing a better part of this year, gotten my net worth thing to almost 19k and Ive only been able to complete 1 sticker book so far. I also find in matchmaking I get stuck on teams with way less levels than the other teams so I started playing solo on the races. Right now Im matched up with a 24.6k, a 33.2k and a 37.8k. the next closest to me is 6k ahead of me! And dont get me started on the push for microtransactions..

After spending so much on the game, I had to uninstall it, at the apps recommendation, because it suddenly wouldnt open. After reinstalling, my account was gone and I now need to request retrieval with data loss warnings. Its connected to my Google account, which makes this confusing. This is disappointing since the apps error forced the uninstall. Submitting the request and gathering receipts felt like too much work, but at least Id already used the dices I paid for. It feels like a waste.

Im in chat customer service right now. My customer service rep, Gio popped in 4 hours ago and then left me hanging. The lack of respect is incredibly hurtful. Gio is showing me that I should think very little about respect and how it DOES impact people. It shows how little value I apparently have in this world. And all it took was a free game, the free game dropping my dice from 680 to 300, and Gio to say hello and decide I was not worth their time anymore. Why am I even here in the world.

This game is merely built to get you to drop money at every turn. Suddenly, you wont land on any meaningful area of the board, miraculously at a time when you seem to need it. Youll be met with numerous popups for more purchases, the next person will always push you out of standings unless, of course, you spend more money. Random players in Shut Downs will have blown up boards but, unsurprisingly, have shields. Stay away unless you have deep pockets, because theres never enough for them.

Freecash severely lowered the rewards for playing this game. check yourself. not worth playing anymore. I only spent 2 on this game for 1,800 rolls. Monopoly go surely cant be running out of money. Im done. bye. my tip is to only roll in 3x as it produces more and by this strategy I have landed in the top 5 in many events and stay with around 1,500 rolls just from rewards. close to 3,000 rolls upon deletion. Harry Potter is a no go for me. magic is real and shouldnt be tossed around light

This is a good idea to pass time. However as its been stated its glitchy. You dont get the right roll credits, and if you want to succeed in it then you have to spend more money that you shouldnt have to. As far as the events...

can you please make a CLAIM ALL BUTTON. I really dont like the 5mins of nonstop ads and prizes you get the minute you open the app. Its a huge turnoff. Also, you need to make it where people HAVE to build up their landmark or they get penalized or something. Its so annoying to get hit, and then you try to get revenge, but half of the opponents you want revenge on are just trolls who are to to build anything to hit. seriously, I have people on my revenge list thats been on there forever

update reviewresponse  If you were all about a fair experience then you wouldnt charge people like you do either less for more or more for less for the same deals etc. And its obvious when the game starts to manipulate you rolls as to cause you to land right before skip every tile that would benefit you to advance because it was needed and so close to a reward as to get you to buy dice spend money hopefully. yes you could wait for the 40 free dice a hr to have each roll just shy again.

PLEASE consider changing game mechanics in the Race events. I would like to choose if I participate or not. If a player doesnt add ppl to their team, players are AUTOMATICALLY ADDED at Race start. If one chooses not to play, that is unfair to the rest of the team that they have been placed with. The partner events is fine. If a player chooses not to participate they simply dont add other players.

I have reached level 700, which shows my commitment and effort, yet I have not received any rewards at all.

Its a great game. My only complaint is that I see a lot of people that have a 600 or even 1200 dice cap, and Im still at 400. Its not based on net worth, as people with a lower net worth than me have more dice. doesnt seem fair that I have to compete with people who have more than twice the amount of dice that I have. it would be cool if yall could address that.

It has been fun and I have been playing for a year. The events are tough but a lot of fun. I have not had any trouble with it until now. I got on the game and my roll capacity was down by 200. Roll Regeneration down 40 rolls. Been in customer service chat waiting for help for 5 hours when they finally got someone to help me.

my last rating of this game was in August of 2023 and since then I still believe its a fun way to kill time and if I dont finish a partner or solo event its just a free game in the end. oddly enough there seems to be a statistically impossible number of complaints that are all somehow old players that dont have the stats theyd earn if they were playing daily 3 plus years now. I think MoGo and scopifly have a negative review bomb on their hands which isnt fair to the actual players who like it

I was really enjoying the app and you get a certain amount of roll dices. I managed to get a limit of a 1000 they give you a 100 dice rolls every hour. they then halved this randomly to 500 rolls. I believe this is a tatic to get you to buy credits which you can do on the app. they say its to trial and see if it works better by having less rolls on the app but I dont see that they have put other benefits. really disappointing. in response to scopeply not when your decreasing roll dices.

The game is fun but the rolls are rigged, especially in the mini games on the center of the board. Spins that dont have enough momentum will magically push to the next slot, or they will give you back to back the smallest rolls possible, preventing you from finishing the mini game. The Devs will deny the game is rigged, but it is. If you play long enough youll see it.

They periodically nerf your ingame earned rewards, like higher maximum rolls and roll Regen with the excuse they are testing (on live server, not PTR) and balancing (they simply remove everything you grinded for, i.e. your progress is fake). An awful and abusive practice way beyond your usual gatcha tactics. The game is fun though, they just deliberately decided to ruin it to make it more profitable, which kind is the whole point of late capitalism, the subject of the original game.

This was a 5star game before the last 2 updates. Its definitely my favorite game and only game omp. Every since the last 2 updates it wont even load. It either boots me out before it loads or boots me out during the pop ups after the games load. Itll also boot me out if I switch my opponent during a shutdown or if I win anything such as stickers, dice or money. Please fix this so I dont have to delete my favorite game. Once its fixed Ill give it 5 stars immediately.

The game started off fun but then as you get higher up in the game you start loosing money and stickers from players who steal from you. I would wake up and all of my money would be gone properties destroyed and no sheilds because theyre all up in the middle of the night playing and paying to win and to screw you. The game is definitely a rigged pay to win or youre not going anywhere. Pretty sad how much greed has consumed so many people. And for that I have uninstalled this game.

Beware! I really enjoyed this game. As your Net worth progressed, you were rewarded with more dice play and higher retention rates. Then all of a sudden in the middle of game play, they cut everything back to half of what you earned. Customer Service said, it was a test. I was never aware of a test. I thought I was progressing in a game I loved. Dont waste your time to be so disappointed. I dont feel they should be able to take back what you have already earned.

Was fun at first then the games starts making everything unattainable unless you spend money. I have gotten to a high level and can not finish albums due to being gold locked and the game just keeps giving duplicates. It also makes sure to have you land on the spots you dont need for events. Once they got really popular they changed the coding or something because this game is no longer rewarding. Dont start playing.

Ive been playing the game for a few months now. All of a sudden I keep getting the message saying theres a problem and I need to uninstall, then reinstall. When I reinstall, it starts me off on a new profile that works just fine, but I cant access my original. Ive spoken to at least three customer service representatives that have given me links to access my original account, but once I do its the same thing: a message saying I need to uninstall, then reinstall.

This game is so wishy washy on how its ran. dont get too fond over upgrades and leveling up because they will just rip away all youve earned with no notice right after a new event has started. The pop up ads are ridiculous also, you have to fight at least 3 before even getting into your game. Events are rigged by bots and the sticker album is also a joke. I cant believe I wasted my time trying to build up to just get knocked down.

Was fun at first. The more you purchase the more expensive everything gets, the same offers are priced differently for different players. Most recent album I got all stickers except 1 even though I opened multiple safes and collected thousands of stickers. They tried to force me into paying 45 for a wild sticker. other people have gotten identical prizes for Bank of Monopoly at specific levels as well, so its not random they screw you on purpose to gouge you for more money.

The first thing I do when I wake up is play this game  or play video games for a hour or 2 (I dont touch grass). I really love this game the only thing that bugs me is how sticker packs work, they are hard to get after a while and you can only send 5 stickers a day, besides that its a really fun game and its addicting (in a good way) and when I lost my account I asked customer service how to get it back. They told me, and it worked (clutch service btw) overall the game is

The dice will strategically land on nonessential tiles for ages, cycling through the exact same nonessential tiles until dice is almost finished then somehow start landing on significant tiles when the multiplier is lowered. the corner tile, goto jail is one of the most useless tiles, given that you are always told to try again especially if you have a large multiplier in use at the time you land on it. I stopped spending after noticing that purchases dont have any substantial effect.

Way too many pop ups for micro transactions. Had 5 pop ups opening the app to buy things. everything you do warrants more pop ups to buy something. not sure the point of the boards. they go by so quickly, some less than a few minutes. should be an option to choose the board you want after they are unlocked.

I dont believe the game developers understands math. It shows 3 pop ups saying I am out of dice before I run out. EVERYTIME!! It is so frustrating. Then you cant choose your multiplier. It picks for you. If I have 10 dice then I should be able to use a 10X multiplier. Then the game is rigged poorly. The more money you spend then the less luck you get. They are trying to make you spend more money, but it is best to not spend at all for the best results.

I like it, but theres so many popups of things they try to get you to buy, and the prices are ridiculous for whats being offered. The issue is that roll capacity (the amount of rolls you can get before it stops autogenerating over time) and roll regen itself seem to have changed. The amount on both looks like its gone down, and though I cant remember before, I cant even check to see if Im just wrong, as the Net Worth page (where you see all the upgrades) just shows what I have now.

Right. Having played this game for some time now, Ive come to the conclusion that the rewards are starting to dwindle and the allocated requirements for prizes has increased dramatically! There are 10 million  players who are entrapped into gaining pointsrewards but then are penalised with more spending and losing more! I fully understand that if they didnt make some form of profit from the game then it wouldnt make sense whatsoever! But please, give your clients something back!

it clear that there is deliberate barrier to being paid higher winning amounts, anything lower that 70.00 is not a problem. on Dec 3rd. withdrawal became available then when you go to withdraw, it gives you one of 2 message lots of activity try again later or volume level reached today. note this is my 1st withdrawal as of now 12525 at 10pmPT. it still stops you from withdrawing.

I really enjoy this game and have played daily for about 910 months. However, Im frustrated because I have been maxed out at earning 40 dice an hour for the entire time Ive played. But newer players to the game are getting 100 dice per hour! Ive contacted customer service and they said there was nothing they could do. That really hinders my ability to play competitively in the different events. That doesnt seem right at all.

randomly lowered my max rolls from 800 to 500, when I asked they said I was part of a test program they didnt tell me I was in and removed them cause the test was done, but I got those rolls as rewards from the blue tokens so if I wasnt in this test I would have gotten normal rewards instead and them reducing my rolls now is basically stealing my normal rewards I would have gotten.

I have been an avid monopoly go player for 3 years. I played everyday for a year and a half. I could not complete even one album. I was assured the issue was fixed so I came back for the last album. it was not fixed. I in fact feel like theyve added more loop holes with no rewards. kind of like the chocolate frog scandal going on now this album. After I brought this to their attention the customer service agent confirmed the game is designed so you cant complete an album. Then disconnected me

My wife and I have loved playing this game over the past year. However, we ha e noticed here lately that completing events and sticker collections have been almost impossible. I always roll x100 with my dice, which in the past usually had me completing just about any event. For about 2 months now I was rolling x100 and have barely made it past half way of any event that comes through. This is rolling every day, completing quick wins daily, etc. Game has for sure swayed away from player favor.

Honestly the worst game on the Play store and the devs continue to make it worse. Currently the devs are pushing a test in which quantities of dice are randomly assigned, the amount of dice you refresh is based on your base quantity of dice(the higher your dice amount, the more you refresh). and there is no rhyme or reason to their awards. Im higher than several friends and have spent thousands more with lower dice count. And the events all come down to dice spent, so automatic an disavantage

Why does your App always have pagan origins and never Godly ones? Most people just want to play a game without rituals or evil origins written all over it.

I enjoyed Monopoly GO at first, but over time the constant purchase prompts and slowed progress changed how it felt. Purchases are labeled optional, yet spending is repeatedly presented as the way forward, with no free way to limit prompts. Some players may enjoy this model; I didnt once I noticed the pattern. Know the design before investing time or money.

Accused their customers of violating the terms of service or committing violations and suspending their account.

Ive played this game for about 2 years. In the past few months, developers have reduced roll capacity  regeneration without explanation or warning. Albums are increasingly larger so its difficult to complete them without spending money. Ive had a few glitches that have cost me dice, stickers  special event tokens. Customer service refuses to reimburse or look into issues. If you do spend money, items increase in price the next time you want them. Its turned into a money grab.

Great game but the company sucks. I was drafted to be a tester with no notice. Now they change my dice cap whenever they want. Initially to 1000 dice which I thought was just them updating maxes as Ive been playing for years. I LEVELED my cap to 1200. No notice dropped to 600 contacted support, told I was a tester.

edit: reinstalled a year later, and most glitches appear to be fixed. Since the last update, every time any reward pops up, the entire game grays out and freezes. The only solution is to close the game and reopen. Then it repeats every time. Terrible and unplayable.

I usually enjoy the team race, but this HP themed one is horrible at loading the brooms when other team members get one. Ive closed the app and gone back in tried to roll a few times, check other parts of the app and it still wont load. I even tried to restart my phone and checked for updates... disappointed

its really sad because this game used to be fun. You can be a loyal player and trade cards and help people out, but you get nowhere trying to finish a set, you can spend money or roll hundreds of dice at a time but the rewards dont get any higher for what you contribute or what level youre on. its really getting old and not rewarding.

Game is fun but soon enough, a bug or server error or one of bothacker will rob you of some reward or dice or something and customer service will not care at all and you will feel like you want to quit. Also, game is a huge cash grab. Many many people have spent well over 10,000. The game will pop up purchase options a lot lot. Good luck to those who chooses to invest their time and money here.

Honestly such a pointless game. I joined for the Harry Potter season and 90 of the time youre not doing anything related to Harry Potter. You literally just sit and watch as dice auto roll for you and you loop round the board on its own which gives you money. You then use that money to upgrade properties. But once you complete the board you never see any of these properties again. I really dont understand why anyone would play this, its just a complete waste of time

There is no accountability from the developers of this game. Ingame cheating happens and they do nothing about it. I just witnessed a holiday event begin and within seconds, the Top 3 in the event had thousands of points (which can only be earned in the event and cannot be purchased). When I point it out, I get the We cant disclose our actions to your report. HOW DO YOU EXPECT PEOPLE TO MAKE IN GAME PURCHASES IF YOU CANNOT GIVE PEOPLE A REASON TO BELIEVE ITS FAIR?

This game is completely broken. How is it that Ive built over 21,000 buildings and my max dice count is 400 with a 40 regen rate while my friends account only built 5,000 and has a max dice count of 780 and a 96 regeneration rate. I cant even make it out of the 30th place in tournaments and Im sure its because of how messed up the roll rates are. Definitely considering uninstalling this game because its not fun anymore.

Its frustrating having to wait a couple of hours, but having 36 regenerated dice every hour made it less frustrating.

Stopped playing regularly a while back but left it on my device in case I decided to pick it back up for casual play. With the deceptive and predatory ad practice of using advertisement boosts in other games to force players out of the ap they are currently in, opening Monopoly Go without permission it is an immediate uninstall from all devices connected to our plans. This practice is a device security issue and blatantly unethical.

in my opinion theyre just after money and they do more and more things to get it. getting things in the game is constantly harder. when I race im always in 3rd no matter if Im on a team or not, so the only way to overcome that is to spend money. this was the 1st time since I started playing that I payed for something and time ran out so I didnt get the last piece. why are things harder to accomplish? well thats the last time I spend money on this money grab

If I could rate this negative 5, I would. Theyve taken the fun completely out of the game and are trying to force you to spend money. Nope! There are plenty of other games that are actually fun, relaxing, and you dont have to spend money on them. Its impossible to complete the albums. The side games are so rigged for you to spend way too many dice for almost no reward. Oh and MoGo, please dont respond with your pre typed out reply. We all know its BS.

Game was fun for a bit, but then randomly one day my rolling capacity went from 700 to just over 300. When I reached out I was told I was part of a test from the developers that was experimenting with roll capacity and that the test was over. There was zero notice, I had to reach out over the course of two days (because customer service chat is very slow to respond). Prepare to get your hopes up and then lose all the work you thought you had built up over the course of the gameplay uninstalling

scam. manipulative. CS will gaslight you when you message them about whats happening. take screenshots of everything because they will ask for proof. even when you have proof, they find a way to tell you what happened didnt really happen. I encourage everyone to try it for themselves but be aware its addictive. everything is manipulated with intent of getting you to put money into the game. they also change things in the game like your roll capacityhr. 1000 too 500 and tell you its a test :)

The game is only a money grab. Although it could be fun, they make it too hard to finish albums without spending money. I highly recommend you stay away from this game. And to the ad runners, stop running this ad on every game I play. I will never download it again. responding back to Scopely: technically, you are telling the truth. It is free, but... its not and you know its set up to not be. How quick was it that you made millions off the game? I guess you will say that was from ads alone.

I have played this game for 2 years. I have spent over 100 per album to complete the mini games, partners events and tycoon racers. What pisses me off is this. The map I am up to 1149 land mark and play 41,224. It kills me everytime I complete a board I only receive 200 dice. That is an insult. The game is harder to complete an album not enough trades for golden blitzes and the algorithms are off. I will no longer make purchases on next album.

dont waste your time or money. as the game will give certain players a unfair advantage under the beta umbrella. you have some players earning more dice a hour then you can hold if your maxed out. on top of that they will lower your dice if you spend money to try and make you spend more cash even worse off support saying its beta testing. if your beta testing you shouldnt be allowed to make purchases until your able to make it fair across the board for everyone. was a fun game until this.

this game has made so many changes that it just isnt fun anymore. the lucky coin flip is a joke, always landing on tails  if youre lucky enough to land on heads, its just once and you get the absolute worst points. dont dear try to roll on anything higher than x10 because you wont get anything but sent to jail and lose your money every time and itll just waste your dice. itll purposely leave you with just enough money that you cant build but itll be a huge blow to you once stolen.

unfair game. rules are different amongst players. some players can accrue 400 dice while others can get 1000. might not sound huge but for daily players, this is a difference of potentially thousands of rolls each day. this means you are playing against other plays who will always earn more dice than you, making it unrealistic to expect to compete in daily and weekly games. please fix it NOW!

simply a massive corporation scam avoid at all cost App full of bugs, customers service do not support nor acknowledge free users, so useless, worst than virgin! What could be a fun game turned out to be a nightmare. Full of cheat to try and get you to purchase from them. Purely dishonest company. Truly disappointed by this version of the world known board games. Shame and no surprise this company is under investigation for data usage. just a huge scam. Review edited as suggested

Golden stickers are a total waste in SETs! The developers of this game doesnt provide them any type of Golden Sticker in purchases, gifts, or allow trading duplicates with other players. This makes it impossible to complete sets within the prescribed timeframe so that the album completed, making the game a waste of time. Cant even download them!

Its pay to win. The RNG for the stickers suck! I have yet to finish off and get top prize. Here and there they get good ideas and then take them out. Always messing with dice amounts I was up to 1000 then they kicked back to 500, I worked hard to have 1000 nows its gone. dont like that at all. The races are good if you have people working on points, cant kick those out who do nothing. Can be fun at times but mostly just a waste your time game and no real thinking or strategy.

its a fun way to pass time. I love how they have so many mini games and side quests you can complete, it gives you more opportunities to win rolls and money. I love the different boards where you can build up your landmarks and get the achievement ribbons, which also gives you the opportunity to win rolls, stickers and other fun things. Monopoly has come a long way from when I first remember playing the game like 5 or 6 years ago.

You spend money to get to the next level of roll regeneration and roll capacity just so they can bring you back down. I was at 400 capacity and 40 rolls for regeneration and now I am at 240 and 24. Why spend for more dice rolls to upgrade? Was fun until that happened.

Great so far. Hard to get the railroads sometimes and moving the dice gets aggravating All in all with the options U have and still unpredictable and that is a good think. Just when u move the number of v rolls , guess wrong. U have to have a little luck also. Play it hunting and at work sometimes.One of the better games on the net. Played this over 40 years ago and will keep it going in the future! Thanks for making it fun mixed with a little aggravating! Good job

Be careful what you do in this game because all of a sudden now they are taking rolls away from players who have either paid money or worked hard to complete achievements to gain regenerated rolls depending on your level and how much you grind you regenerate a certain amount of rolls per hour I had mine up to 800 then they decided to take 300 of them away that usually take 8 hours because of the grinding I did to receive that amount so now Im losing 900 rolls per day thats 27,000 rolls a month

The game is fun it its a complete money grab. The only way to succeed is to spend money. If you have 1500 dice and the next goal wins you 1000 dice... Youll have to use 1700 dice. It always knows when youre about out of dice and drags you along just enough to keep you going but to actually profit dice it will cost money everytime.

DO NOT DOWNLOAD. This game is VERY predatory with its ads. Whenever you run out of rolls you get 3 pop up adds to buy more dice, every time. Also while Im on the dice, 1 hour for 7 rolls..... are you kidding me. worst energy regen in a game Ive seen in awhile. most are on minute timers not an hour. The biggest grievance tho however is that me and my girlfriend start about the same time. She is now on board 52, while Im on 17... we play the exact same way. If you are smart, HARD pass this game

do not pay to play this game, earned rewards are not promised. you may receive them but later in the game they have the rights to remove them such as Roll capacity, roll regeneration. I was receiving 120 rolls regenerated in a thousand capacity and they just took them all away and put it back to when I first began. I paid to play and I paid to earn them Rewards and over a course of a year it took me that long to get that good at 17,000 points I am only now allowed 50 regeneration rolls 500.

Played this through one of those, earn a couple dollars for trying this game out apps. You get no less than three ads for different micro transactions after using up a resource in a game where you do literally nothing but watch numbers go up and click button to make the number go up and this is not an idle game. One of the power ups is literally just letting you spend your dice faster. Were going to ask you to pay money just to spend digital money faster. Capitalism is the heart of the game

Im ready to just delete the game because unless you play with money you cant win. different people get different offers and even when you are able to spend money on the game either it rips you off by giving less dice or cards on an offer of the same price as someone else yet they get better offers of more dice and stickers to the next player. the tournaments are next to impossible to come in top 3 especially 1st place. they group you with people who have money

The game thrives off of micro transactions, which it will deliberately push down your throat every chance it gets. Seems like the algorithm is written to get you to the threshold of an achievement and then leaves you stuck, forcing you to either purchase things from their shop(with minimal guarantee of reaching said milestone) or delete the game. 1010 would recommend this game to anyone who loves losing regardless of what they attempt. Edit: seems like a lot of these 5 star reviews are lying

Pricing and Rewards are completely unfair. I play with my boyfriend and for some reason he can get deals where he gets 15k20k die for nothing and my deals are quite literally a quarter to a third of his. This includes bonuses and ingame rewards, not just the microtransactions. He gets more seasonal boards than me, more bank of monopoly boards, more everything. I started playing before him and now hes way ahead of me. We compare everything every night and Im so fed up with the  discrepancies

Ive been playing this game for about a year, its addictive and I enjoy it. However, I have never completed a sticker set, My sister has been playing for 2 years has never completed a set. The only way to get anything is to pay 100. I was part of a beta test and had 800 max dice and was still not completing or winning any of the ingame prizes. After this set Im removing the game without it being fixed.

Too Many Aggressive Popups Fun, clever gameplay  hooked me for a week, genuinely amusing. But the manipulative popups ruined everything: 1. Free daily reward: precise swipes  clicks every 8 hours 2. Open the app  purchase window appears, X to close delayed for seconds, then another popup per active deal 3. Dice run out? Instant flood of buymore screens Designed to annoy you into spending. Uninstalled. 210  Great game drowned in predatory popups.

Please put in game chat for racers event its crucial when we need to contact our partners to let them know weve sent them a prize or dice or whatever it may be. I lost last partners race by 10 points because I couldnt let my partner know they had flags.

Maximum dice roll decreased from 1000 to 500 with no warning. I feel robbed as a loyal player for over a year whos made ingame purchases I think its unfair. Customer service terrible, I wont be playing anymore and I suggest people find a different game. Disappointed as I used to love the his game

Not child or gambling addict friendly or healthy, encourages addiction to gambling and online gaming. Bombards with adverts to buy things with many chances to accidentally click to purchase if youre not careful. Deliberate tactic in all pay to win games. This game is more cynical than average though, more so now, they only want new players or big spenders. For everyone else they try and squeeze the life and joy from the game with addiction being the only factor keeping a player playing.

it was going great, I was really enjoying it, I spent a decent amount of money building up my rolls and roll capacity, all for it to be reset back to 300 without warning... which way i see it, they basically took my money and then took away the items I bought with it... well I wont be spending anything else on it, whats to stop them doing it again if I build them back up reply, Im not really interested in other players, I built up a roll capacity through spending money, thats the issue

ITS A GAMBLING GAME MASQUERADING AS THE BOARD GAME. There is nothing random in this game, it is all rigged so that you cant complete levels. First few levels are easy and it gives lots of rewards but it has become so difficult that you hardly win any rolls and the center, top and side games hardly give any rewards. It forces you to pay money for rolls to complete challenges etc!!!! !Customer service is bad, development responses are not even truthful. Look at the reviews all over web.

too many pop ups asking for cash, obviously the only way to win the challenges is to pay to win. not to mention the obvious cheating by the game with the number of times you randomly  roll to land in jail hitting the same spot averaging 3 out of 5 times around the board is statistically impossible. thanks for the unhelpful autogenerated feedback, how about addressing the random dice rolls. why dont you provide board stats. ie, number of times around the board and stats for each spot

This game is rigged. You have to spend money to win. In the mini contests they purposely choose partners for you that dont play so the only way to win is spending money. I contacted support and they say they will review it for next time. In competitions they put players that are 3 and 4 times the amount of levels. my level was at 6000 my competition was at 18,000 , 20,000 and 25,000. In this latest one the Thanksgiving guy who choose me didnt even play. its a scam. Im uninstalling

Initially a fun game and a great time killer. The devs have absolutely no respect for the player base  Changing both your roll cap and dice regen whenever they want. The in app purchasesdeals directly sync with this total too, so you get less for your money. When you reach out to ask why youre simply told youre part of a test despite not signing up for a test. They halved mine overnight. I spent too much on this app  dont be like me.

Biggest Scam In Mobile Gaming: I was enjoying this title, moving up the unlocks  meeting new acquaintances. Then I chose to spend a little money. immediately after that, my builtup roll count, which was well over 500, was cut back to 280  my refresh rate was reduced. All done in the name of build variations. Nobody I know who plays, it is having the same problem. So, after a fully unsatisfactory communique with customer support, Ive decided to uninstall this game. Boycotting.

This game is Pay To Win game. After a few season i played this game, i never finish the album because the gold card is very HARD to get. If you think you can win the tournament and get the gold card after purchase from their shop, absolutely not. Dont even think waste your money on this game. They set up the system to make you lose so that you will buy extra dice from their shop.

I have a question, now that Ive been a player for over a year, why is it I will play the highest amount of my dice will go yet in the end it doesnt matter regarding the leadership board because it is the landing on RR that gets you higher up the board, which isnt truly fair, cant you make it more fair for those who play with higher dice count to receive an award for a spot at the top? The RR is kinda like the luck of the draw which doesnt make you a better player?

This is a very creative, thoughtfully designed, rewarding game. You dont have to spend money. There are no Paywalls. You can run out of money and dice, but you get daily login bonuses, and patience will build you a fortune. I didnt log in for a couple of weeks and came back to millions of dollars and hundreds of dice. This is one of the best games of this type I have ever played! It borrows from a few other game structures and gives it that Classic Monopoly flair.

I get that some people say its frustrating but, it is part of the game. I dont spend a penny on this game and, I love it. Sometimes I have over 1000 rolls, others, I have none. There are other ways of increasingvyour rolls, other than paying for them. Ryan and others, dont give up, keep going. If itvis causing you stress, delete. I enjoy it myself but its not for everyone.
