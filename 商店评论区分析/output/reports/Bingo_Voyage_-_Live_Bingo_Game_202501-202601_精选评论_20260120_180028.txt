its not bad. I like the general design and UI and the voices, sounds, and music arent annoying. con: get ready to spend money. what I really dislike is that it becomes very obvious very quickly that you will have to spend money if you ever want to progress along the journeys. you need puzzle pieces to unlock new voyages but only the 2nd tier bet gives you those. the first tier is 40 in game dollars to play 4 cards but the 2nd tier is 400 to play 4 cards. you earn maybe 500 a day free.

Things I feel are right: auto calls Bingo so you dont miss it, no cooling off between powerups, good so far about enough money to keep playing, customizable outfits for avatar. Things I wish were different: powerups seem expensive and not super generous in being able to earn them, free daub powerup (if on auto) will sometimes daub the last number called before you can do it, extra daub cannon balls often dont land on beneficial squares. Still, its the one bingo I havent deleted yet

this game is super fun the only thing i think they need to improve on is when you have extra cards and you want to give them a way to people, you need to have a system where they can track what extras you have and what extras.Someone else needs because im getting requests for cards.I dont have and when im going to send the extra cards, it just excuse me, my friends list without telling me who needs that card

I love this game! Well except for the part where you get tons of of dollars to play in the beginning but the bingo rooms start costing soooo much! there needs to be more ways to get the cash to play! The daily reward is barely 100 and its like double, triple that to play a good room. Then when u do play, unless you get like 10 bingos on your cards you barely get half of what you paid back. They should make it easier for people who cant afford to buy the pack to be able to play consistently!

Loved it in the beginning, just over 2 weeks playing, update has been done, now more expensive to buy into a bingo game and payouts are ok if you win. You need a great supportive team to keep playing if they help you complete stage collection items and cards to complete sets for reasonable rewards.

It is fun when you get to play. Takes too long to earn mula to play better and more rounds. Should not have to spend a bunch of money just to enjoy the fun of BINGO. Contemplating deleting but holding out hope in huge jackpot win that takes days to play at the level that wins more rounds and side games. UPDATE I deleted

A small suggestion...if you would give the player an option of changing the daub color and also for the advanced players such as myself I noticed that when I make an inapp purchase and the next time that you have a special running, the price is always higher than it was before I first made the initial purchase. I dont have big money available throughout the month so it would be nice to have the option to get a smaller package regardless. Otherwise I give the game 5 stars. Love the game!!!

Brilliant game except I really wish the minimum amount of tickets didnt get higher as it went on some days I only have enough tickets for one round, I would definitely spend more time on this game if there was an option to use a lower amount of tickets and still get rewards at the moment I have to use 2000 tickets for one round and thats just my free daily allowance once Im out thats it .. please look in too lowering the ticket amount so more people can play for longer

I wish we could trade in powerups for others. I have 422 right now and 367 of them are just chests! Its highly annoying. I also wish the cash prizes were a bit higher considering playing price goes up quite a bit. You make enough for one game overnight after you get to 1200. Also hate spending 1200 and not getting a single bingo. Its like either you jackpot, barely get by or lose your butt. Otherwise very enjoyable as far as events and things.

graphics are great, you get lots at first but then you cant even do the events with the free ticketslevel ups. spent money to buy packs and such (VIP 6) but it only helps you for a day. devs need to lower the ticket requirements for the events. I would keep spending but 30 is steep when thats 2 5 rounds depending on my luck if I want to participate. and yes I bought basically every pack so dont tell me theirs variety. anyways there are games with better late game. such as bingo frenzy.

Honestly, I really love this game specially when I won and claim free tickets daily and log in rewards but lately it annoyed me its hard to win this time unless you purchase some tickets to keep playing yes I purchased 2 times previously, but this time I did not its really hard to win now. lost my interest  of plying it   those time. hard to say goodbye but I think I have to let it go now  heeeeh I gonna miss my friends here.

Once you get past level 130 bingos come less and less. EDIT. Now at level 219 and it keeps getting worse. the animations after rounds are too slow and cause you to miss rounds. the new Egyptian room takes way too much to get the quest trail done. Lobby have been adjusted so if you miss the entry period you have to wait.No more instant lobbies when you go to play. After level 200, the bingos come less and less and you start to see the same people with. over and over. Many players have quit.

Its OK, was low cost to but then they did and update and the same packs that were less than a fiver are now a tenner the packs that were but all for around a tenner is now nearer 20 quid, pre update I won more often now even with the 30 minute double boost Im lucky to get one. That boost always starts with a double xp or chests as soon as the boosts ends my starts a instant bingos and daubers, used to be resonable now I have to collect my daily 2000 for 10 days to play a little.

Was really loving this game, but it seems like something has changed, I rarely get bingos now which is clearly a ploy by the creators to get you to spend money, I can maybe get 1 game a day with the daily rewards and they force you to play with higher tickets or you miss out on rewards that help you advance through levels. Also, its basically impossible to collect all the cards without paying for packs, because you constantly get the same cards over and over, and even then, not guaranteed

erm guys .. whoever developed your Oktoberfest game... obvs has never been to one. For a start, the atmosphere is completely wrong. you dont have smart waiters with trays of beer.. and you certainly dont have soft, mellow and pretty annoying jazz music in the background. its a raucous event with waiters in traditional garb, buxom barmaids in traditional costume, and OOOMPAH MUSIC,. Its a lively party atmosphere.. not some dingy quiet bar .. dropped the pretzel on this one folks!

Nice game, good graphics, only one snag. It costs a lot to stay on top. I had 165k and had no big wins after this, and I went all the way down to 1k in a matter of 2 days. Did not matter how I played. I could not win any amount over 5k. Lately everything is more difficult to win anything, critter heist pays disappointing. when I select to call balls in my group im lucky to call one correct ball out of 20. Very disappointing how these apps upgrade then no more wins. Be prepared to spend a lot.

I really love this game my only problem is the tickets I really wish it was better because you dont win enough tickets without having to purchase I like that we get free tickets daily but its only enough for one game and if you do get a few bingos you dont even win enough for another game everything else is ok but the ticket part needs work fix that and I will give 5 stars

disappointed in the app which I still love it but now I put my own money in it leaves me with the question why I hit the jackpot and never received it and the fact I bought 4.99 deal and received cards that I had at the beginning of the game and now I cant seem to get my level ups as I should and have the game glitch on me and take my winnings now I cant play because the game seems to take and not receive its rightfully earnings I need a refund at least 5 of it .I had no time to auto correct

I have been playing this close to 3 months, and in my opinion this is a pay to win game, dont get me wrong you can progress without paying which I have done but you are lucky to even get a win! occasionally you will win big, so you up your stake and then a dry run until you are out of tickets.! same with the collectors cards very rarely get new ones to complete collections. us non players should have a few more tickets to enable us to play more

This is one of my two favourite bingo games. Filled with competitions in addition to the bingo, just like being on a cruise ship. These competitions increase bingo tickets, can play without ingame purchases. Join a team and feel part of a fun collective. Graphics are excellent. Cannot withdraw any winnings from game. Winnings are measured in terms of game tokens. EXCELLENT GAME.

This is one of the best bingo games that Ive played in a very long time. It would have gotten a 5 Star rating if they didnt have so many bots that take away from the playing experience of the game. To me, that just means youre trying to scam people into buying the add one. Why not just let the REAL people who want to play, just play the game the way its intended to be played?? What is really the point of a GAME if its rigged from the beginning?? Get rid of your bots andyou have the BESTGAME

Ive always thought of bingo as boring, but this one isnt because it has a ton of side games and thats what keeps you going over the monotony of having numbers called. I really enjoy this and then because youre playing against other people or at least the computer trying to get that first bingo or multiple bingos is a lot of fun too I wish just FYI that maybe you should have an option for blackout bingo. those are a lot of fun

this would be the best bingo game out there if it wasnt for the fact, if you dont pay you dont play. entertaining, lots of variety. very smooth game play And it has everything you want in a little bingo game. when I first played I was getting mass intergame play.plentynof bingos to go around. then it stopped. slow you trickle down to two cards and you cant get anywhere. cant pay higher because all the bingos stopped. so your broke its pathetic. do I recommend it only if you always pay.

I really enjoy playing this game, but I think we should be able to choose our bets.. also when we make bingo we lose more than what we earn, to at least get back what you bet you need to be in the top 3, if not you just make some of your bet and lose the rest. Overall is very interesting game

This is my favorite Bingo app and Im happy with everything but how you need to pay more bingo cash to play as you advance. Im nearing level 300 and one bingo card is around 1k minimum. Also, Im positive the ratio of wins declines at a rapid pace, the more you play. I dislike this type of game play as it seems predatory and counts on taking advantage of players loyalty once its clear they will continue playing. This is to compel people to purchase bingo cash and its unethical.

This is the easiest most relaxing game ever on Tester Up, and your micro earnings becomes substantial as you play, If you need a peaceful and quiet diversion, this is the game app for you, Bingo voyage, the graphics are ultra class and it doesnt squeeze you into buying inapp. They just let you play then pay you for your moment of enjoyment and they also induce temporary amnesia that you forget all your worries as you play. I cant wait to share this game to my Mom...Hi Mom!

I really like this game, its fun to play but now that Ive reached a higher level its almost impossible to win a bingo because you have to bet higher to win cards. The price for tickets and coins is outrageous and even if you buy an expensive package your tickets to play go so fast because of how high you have to bet to pass a level. The pop ups for packages and new competitors gets overwhelming to have to close they pop up after every game played. I hope improvements are made soon!

initially not bad. but you cant ever build up tickets which you need to play, without reaching high enough wager (betting more tickets) you cant progress even if you win. even a first place bingo rewards you with only the same number of tickets used to play 1 card. play 6 cards  50 tickets each300 tickets, win 4 bingos and receive 200 tickets. and enough to play again is around 3 bucks for a single round on a free game of bingo. Junk

really like play the game but everytime you make a purchase with the deals or specials the price gets higher. started at 29.99 then went to 49.99 then 59.99, 79.99, now its at 99.99 for the compo I get and I cant afford that. another thing is I wish we can aim the cannon especially if we dont get a bingo we get that last chance. the bingo algorithm needs some work as well.

Used to be great! I played a lot and Ive got to Level 281, but these last few weeks Im hardly winning, the bets cost double what you win, you need at least 2 bingos to break even and i very rarely get 1. 2 months ago I had over 200k tickets, now Ive got 93k, playing exactly the same but the algorithms must have changed. Im really struggling to keep playing as its so demotivating, seeing my ticket numbers fall and nothing I can do about it. Please, whatever you changed, please change it back

I am really enjoying this game but I find that the amount of tickets required to play versus the amount received back as a reward is vastly different. You need hundreds to play but unless you get multiple bingos on multiple cards you are getting less than half back. Theres very few ways to get tickets unless you purchase and even then the amount needed is so high and the amount in packs is still low. This needs to be rebalanced or there need to be more ways to get tickets that isnt buying.

Fun game play with a fair amount of variety. I just wish there were. a way to watch ads in exchange for more Bingo money. It would also be nice if I could exchange some of my powerups for different ones. I have over 500 chests that I will never manage to use because the game generally allows only one of each type per round, so I keep having to pay coins for other powerups rather than using my stock of chests.

Meh. You need a bingo on each card youre playing to make back your money for a round. There is no possible way the numbers are randomized  Ive hit a double win once and double experience (which has no real use in the game) Every. Single. Round. More often than not it will give you the double dob power up at the beginning of a round when its practically useless. Update, literally 80 percent of my power ups are now chests (not useful). Devs seem to be actively making this game worse.

Fun game but it is really infuriating when tickets are hard to get and you have to wait really long to get them for free. The further you go, the more ticket prices to play rises and its so hard to complete stages. I do not recommend paying for any bundles, dont waste your money on it. You will later realize that if you pay for a bundle, one or two games later without any bingos, you will have to pay to get more. Its ad free but wish we could get tickets with ads.

its a great way to kill time and it makes you feel good in the rare instance that you win... The side games they have are almost impossible to win unless you spend a bunch of money. The team games are trash since half the team decide not to help at all. They make it so difficult to complete card collections unless you pay a bunch of money and even then, you will have multiples of other cards and they will even put regular cards in the special packs just to mess you up even more.

negative a milliondaily updatesand added resourses because you suck at coding, dont want anything more than the original bingo, no side quests. and screw the Ellen DeGeneres art, horrible. play to build the boat with money. boring. tripeaks is the same way and bingo blitz is pay to play also. there are no bingo games without all these add ons. and the tutorial takes over 30 minutes to complete. glad Im not a stupid American who has to be told how to play the game everytime you change phones.

I love this bingo out of all the other bingos I have played. you can automate the extra help so that you dont need to keep track of when its full during a game. The thing I love the most that was at the end it gives you a timer so you have chance to actually find the last number. and a lot of the other games I have played it shows you the number then just stops the game so you could have gotten a bingo but they didnt give you a time enough to press the last number. I love this bingo game

This game takes a colossal amount of storage. I loaded BV onto a brand new tablet a few days ago and it is the first, and only, app Ive installed on it. Storage space was about 53 when first installed. This has now gone up to a whopping 30.8GB32GB (96) within just a few days and I havent used the tablet for anything else at all. This makes the game run slow and clunky. Ive cleared caches, etc, with no effect. A few other issues as well but need more space here to explain.

Im disappointed. It took months of hard work to get my club up to where it was just to have it taken away from me cause of needing personal time away for personal reasons. If I cant have my club back, then, Im leaving. It should be up to us if we want to keep it or not. For that reason alone is why you got a 3. it would have been a 5 cause i have enjoyed playing your app

the only reason this game is getting 2 stars is due to not having to pay for no adds. however, the winnings of the game suck! you can win a tonnnn of bingo tokens, but cant use them for anything. its incredibly to get power up tokens, and when you want to buy something with your winnings. its usually your power up tokens. so you get all these bingo tickets but cant use them to buy rewards. its either you use real money. or your power up tokens. theres so much more to add but cant!

Not bad there are ebb and flows when it comes to winning streaks. Your odds are increased if you PTP. The newest update to clubs improved play. Game would be funner if they had more overall options in Avatars for Black, Brown  Asian individuals. The thumbnail avatar only has one ambiguously raced woman. The play avatar has limited hair and skin tone features.

Read till the end. It IS a great BINGO game. Yep its got everything. But heres the thing. The further you move through the game, the higher you have to bet to get rewards so they give less and take more, way more. And as you progress, and if your someone who doesnt mind purchases, the prices just keep going up and up. Look if you are vulnerable to dopamine chasing this game is the ultimate dopamine dealer. Its greedy. It takes more than than it gives and they are blatant about it. Greedy.

I enjoy the game but cant play often because the bets are so high  the payout doesnt do much. Im on a fixed income  its so disappointing because I do enjoy the game. Not to mention that the betting level goes up higher as you advance. 800 bet min just to try for a puzzle piece. The other events are even higher. Lowest bet 80 lucky you win 30 back. No sense in wasting the time unless just playing for club balls. That doesnt last very long either. Not everyone can afford to play this game.

when i first started playing thus game, absolutely fantastic, but now 10 days left too finish my first album, normally I would be on my 3rd album, they have changed this game for the worst ever, bingos are hard too get, they want you too spend, money but dont give anything back, all you get is we will pass your information on, not interested in our opinions, I normally can finish the fortune game but this time I think at the ,moment I have 3 or 4 numbers. shocking now but theyre not bothered

one of the most egregious, scammy, greedy game out there. as you advanced u need thousands of tickets to play a round of 4 cards. every pack exceed 50. every round is predetermined, even rigged casinos in vegas is more subtle than that, only when u paid a fortune, over 50 thats when they treat u to multiple bingo to hook u in, you are better off burning ur money for warmth than waste it on this game. it might have faster ticket gen than other game, but this one is a design to scam, cheat u.

New club changes bad, games are too expensive and they rig the games, its pretty obvious. Just decided to test how fair the joker card game is by selecting the same card spot over and over. I got the joker in that spot 7 out of 10 times, which is impossible if the game was truly random. Its meant to be a 1 in 4 chance, so the joker should have only appeared approx 25 of the time, instead he appeared over 75 in that spot. happens with games too. do not spend money on this game. they cheat.

its not like the ads  after a little while you stop winning and they want you to buy stuff. If you buy once, you keep losing so they can get you to buy more. There are no games saving people like in the ad. There are no games with the cute old lady like in the ad. There is no option to play more than 6 cards (the ad shows 8)

was loving this game but for the last 2 weeks or more now when I enter a game click on my cards it brings me back out to the deck and says new round sarts in how ever many seconds and continues to take the coins but once I leave and come back I get the coins back but the same thing happens again. .

its decent game play and graphics, but the clear algorithmic manipulation of win frequency that leads to needing to make in game purchases makes it less fun to play. I know they say its totally random, but its not. some of us know how to see patterns. I used to play daily, and even bought all the ingame passes. but not anymore because the win ratio is less than 30. not going to waste my money.

used to love plating this game. used to win Bingo several times, now something changed, only hitting Bingo a couple times. this makes winning puzzle pieces to move along the map so much more daunting. the ticket cost per game is real high if you eant the chance to win a puzzle piece. plus when only using free daily tickets you get just a few games to play without making a purchase. go back to previous update.

The game is really fun, but unfortunately it lacks fairness. All servers are merged into the same match, which makes the choice of two or four cardsand even their valuemeaningless. Everyone ends up in the same match regardless. This creates an unbalanced and unfair experience. I hope the developers take this into consideration and make the necessary changes to ensure a more fair and competitive environment.

if I can give zero stars I will, the game become scam, the developers really make it worthless, whats the point to make a game which is really good In its graphic and design then ruins it with such stupid strategy, no matter how many games you play you will never get any bingos on the board, it will let you get one or two in your first game, then you will lost all your tickets without getting any bingos on board, no matter how many games you will play, you will get nothing, and thats globally

I love this game. I really do. I just dont like how the first place bingo thing seems rigged. dont get me wrong, Ive gotten first place before, but I never win as much as some people do. Ive seen people win up to 1,000 tickets, meanwhile the most Ive ever won quite literally was 90. it does get quite frustrating, especially when you spend 100 just to win 5 or 0. overall though, its very fun and relaxing.

I just had this BINGO and it was thru another promotional app. I played well and at times I think it was cheating? It would jump ahead and started playing before I could open the window. I dont have my scores It never payed  out  like they promised Or when I was playing this. I found another and I hope it pays out something? A lady can wish  . I could have been a keeper, but I cant play with a computer  that cheats.

Currently its not possible to scroll back through the list. I have ADHD, with a form of dyslexia. Im using Googles voice to text feature to type my request. Your game is incredibly fun!

Fun game, no ads and lots of other side games for entertainment. I also like there is no cool down or wait time to use the power ups. Main issues: game freezes  force closes after bingo rounds. Have to always restart. You dont win enough even with leveling up. You have to play more to win more but its no guarantee youll win especially since the bingos rounds are short. So you may get a win but you dont win much compared to your entry cost. Youll win say 50 but paid 150 to enter the game

its fun. I like how theres no ads. my only problem would be the lack of options of how to get cash. you cant watch an ad for cash and its 2 for a 140 in game cash which will get you absolutely nothing in the game if Im being honest. you can pretty much play a single round everyday because of how expense it is to play and the significant lack of options to get cash too. overall, I do enjoy the game, but good luck actually being able to sit down and play for a while.

Overall the game is well made and easy to play.The 2 star is because the game is an absolute money grab.When Im betting 800 tickets on 6 cards, get one single bingo and Im paid out 200 tickets, you burn through tickets fast.It doesnt help that the average win per game is only 1 bingo.Maybe if the payouts were better, or you win a little more, it wouldnt be such a blatant attempt to make you buy packs.I dont mind supporting a game if it is primarily player focused, this game isnt though.

The game design is very beautiful but it is very furstrating when playing because of the tickets that do not allow you to play consecutively. You finish them in one game and when you raise the bet, it does not let you win any others.The game rewards you with bingoes only once in a while.

I installed this game due to the short ad I saw several times. Where we had to get numbers on our bingo lines to save people from death. NOT as advertised. I should have known better. Its another click bait game just like royal kingdom. I really wish they would stop those ads and really show the true came. It would save me a lot of effort.

I want to give this 5 stars because I LOVE this game, but..the higher your level the more you have to bet for the minimum to win a single puzzle piece. Im level 101 and I cant bet less than 600 dollars if I want a chance at a puzzle piece. thats basically 10 for a single game. I get basically 1 game a day and if its a bust Im out of cash. would love this completely if the minimum bet didnt change, I didnt become richer with each level, I cant afford to play

Bingo Voyage has gone downhill fast. You lose far more than you win, and tickets run out so quickly that you basically have to spend moneysometimes up to 80for a chance to keep playing. Club battles were moved to weekends, removing a lot of the fun, and the algorithm now seems geared toward making you lose. Many players have noticed the drop in wins, especially once you progress past the first month. At this point, the game just feels like a money grab!

Dear Developers, Please consider allowing players to exchange gold cards. Many of us have invested significant money and effort to collect rare cards, only to end up with unusable duplicates. It feels unfair to win or purchase items we cant trade or use effectively. Additionally, the chat moves too fast during tradescould you introduce a slow mode or better trade functionality? The platform could also benefit from improved navigation. Many loyal players are growing frustrated. Please listen!

Great game until its not. Some how prizes are always less than tickets you pay to participate leaving a very rare chance to actually top up the amount of tickets and once youre out buying a pack doesnt help either. I rarely get any bingo now and even if I do, the prize is do small that all my tickets disappear quickly to a moment where I can only play the loves rank and earn 2 tickets for a first place bingo which is ridiculous.

I really like this game, sadly after the first 15 levels or so it turns into having to buy things or being stuck with no power ups and barely any bingo funds to play. They do give you multiple ways to get extra dollars but once that runs out youre out of luck. a lot of the special rewards and special levels cant even be played unless you have a lot of funds available.

I did enjoy playing this game. keeps me entertained, however you have to bet higher if you want to get puzzles and participate in events. With that, you can probably only play around 23 games per day unless you spend money. And as you play along the prices of ingame purchase also skyrocket. You rarely get even with your gameplay and you have to wait next day to regain game credit worth 1 gameplay unless you spend again. Expensive game if you want to keep playing.

this is my favourite version of bingo, but it annoys me how expensive the cards are on some games and then the lower ones give little to no rewards. then the power balls at the end of a game the majority of the time the hit pointless numbers. hardly ever does it give bingos. obviously the less bingos you get the less tokens you get back. unfortunately some of us cannot afford to play to play. I have adhd and not winning anything gets boring for me and makes me not want to play.

This game is cheating so you can spend money to buy more notes. After you spend money on it, they make sure you lose fastest, so u will spend more. I regret spending real money on it and stupid to fall for their tricks. I wouldnt recommend this to any of my friends for sure. It is a scam to make you spend money.

Very good game. Would of been 5 stars but the progression of the bingo game costs Vs per day income is unbalanced at higher tier. sometimes requires 3 days of daily collections to play a single round. The Purchase options pop up very regularly after every 3 rounds or so. its annoying to have to close 67 pop ups just to continue to play. The game play itself is second to none however.

It was enjoyable until i realsed it pushes you into a pay wall. The further you progress the more tickets it costs and although you get daily tickets, they only cover one or two games. the lowest costung ticket prevents you from collecting any items that can help you earn tickets.

This game used to be really fun. It was pretty easy for me to level up, and while I didnt get bingos all of the time, I got them frequently enough to keep the game moving. Now at level 199, everything is at a snails pace. A couple of weeks ago, I noticed that its ridiculously difficult to get any bingos now. I get perfect daubs, but the boards are covered with places that could have been bingos but never are. I cant do multiple games a day like I used to.

Not an awful game but the prizes are awful so you cant progress ticketwise as you have to bingo every single game to maintain tickets to play. Ticket cost increases as you level up but the return is just as terrible so you very quickly run out of tickets.

so I really enjoy the game with the exception of some of the little special dabs. sometimes when you get the additional dabs they will dabb on a number that youre currently trying to dab yourself also when you get the extra dabs at the end and when you get the double one it always does one on card one off card so its not really a perk and it gets really frustrating and sometimes the payouts dont match the prices of the card

As everyone else is saying you will not get many bingos after you reach a certain level. I cant even get to level 100. The first game I play when I log on I will get some bingos but after that you just lose and lose.

Not enough time to collect everything to make it in time for the next game with over 100 seconds til the next game. The games are way too expensive and to get ahead you have to play at least 2x so I only play 2 cards. I play for a little while then go to other bingo games that are cheaper to play and you dont have to wait forever. 500.00 to play 2 cards????? Now its 600.00! Yep you guessed it! 800.00 now

(Edited review after playing about 100 or so hours)At first I really enjoyed this game, but since I lost my job I havent purchased anything lately. I have had lots of free time to play so I have at least 50 or more hours of play to come to this conclusion. Im forced to loose now no matter what I do. For a long time it wasnt this way, only recently. I averaged 1 bingo every 3 cards, now 1out of 10 or more. get 4 numbers waiting only to have 12 or more balls called without hit on 1. foul low

Did enjoy now its just frustrating. The higher you rank the more it costs to play a single game. You cannot play this game for very long before you lose all of your tickets, coins  boosters. Then the offers. My God. If you buy once, guess what? The next offers to purchase are upwards of 60. Youd think theyd want people on their app playing for longer periods but nope.

Fantastic until you finish a level. Laziest creaters ever. Finished the album last week and still no new area or album!!! Unbelievable that folk have to wait so long to play again. Get it together and work on new levels. God knows you charge enough money to buy the dollars needed to play. 4000 per game but you only win 1000 per game  then wait weeks for new levels.

great fun. the only thing Id change is a way to adjust the speed in the calling of the bingo numbers. when youre playing more cards it would be nice if you could slow it down just a bit, or have the option of (or buy) autodaub.

I could play 10,000 games with 60 cards each vs 1 player with one card and they would have a blackout before I could DREAM of hitting a single bingo... seriously... I spent all the free stuff (34 bingo games) still no bingo outside of level 1 game 1 and now I uninstall because I am not spending real money to have a bad time. I hope the devs of this abomination all stub their toes between 3 and 30 times a day for the rest of their lives. fuk you all

This game was my go to, daily bingo game for a LONG time. I loved the ability to be able to consistently play, and never HAD to buy. In the past couple weeks, Ive exhausted almost all my tickets and the gameplay has DEFINITELY changed. Never have I had such a long losing streak, or lost as many tickets as I have now. 2M tickets gone in a matter of days sadly. Unfortunately it is not a game I would recommend for longevity. I really thought found a diamond, but alas, its coal.

This is definitely pay to play. The side quests cost an unreasonable amount of tickets to participate and the rewards are not worth the amount of tickets required. Any purchases made in the game will result in higher and higher prices. Duplicate cards for the collections are very common and you get nothing for them, the stars usually result in more duplicates. Could be fun if it wasnt so expensive.

my experience is bad. the game is rigged. out of 20 games, there is a chance of winning 1 only. the bingo numbers are very much predictable and will never come in your favor. above all the players are in the favor of the developers as well. within seconds they win bingos and within seconds the game is over. it is very very annoying and disturbing. no doubt it is a very addictive game and it is a fun game....but as I mentioned above, I am losing interest in this game, as it is totally RIGGED.

MOVE ON!! If your thinking about trying this game just move onto another. This game is highly rigged and you have ZERO chance of ever winning and getting ahead. Game is rigged for you to lose constantly, you can get a triple bingo and three others and you still win less than your bet, the dirty developers design it this way to force you to eventually have to pay them to play then it costs you money for them to scam you and rip you off! The developer is a dirty liar who wont admit to rigging

I was loading into a game and instead of starting the game, I was taken back to the log in screen. Ive had that happen, however, this time I actually had to log back in instead of it automatically doing it like it has in the past when it crashed. I tried logging in with my fb like I have before, and it asked me to create a new account.

Not for the game but the support. I have purchased a package, but the game paid fewer tickets than advertised. i have opened a support ticket since 11 hours ago, and an AI bot is supposed to help with the purchase issue. since the first 4 to 5 autoreplies nothing. this is fraud. is not the price is the misguidance and unprofessionalism of the authors that failed after getting 100s of thousands not to have an appropriate support system even when their own game is ripping off their customers.

Recouping the cost of cards requires four rare bingo wins. Coin purchases are excessively priced, demanding a significant investment for sustained play. The new Helicopter powerup, which dabs two random numbers, frequently marks the very next number called, raising questions about the true randomness of the feature. Collect action that demands precise screen tapping (where it says collect, not just anywhere on the phone screen!) to deposit winnings, creating an annoying, unnecessary step.

This game has 2 things that ruin it. The inability to skip the long wait of showing me ever single little thing won and where it goes as it slowly counts it for me, after each and every round AND then in between rounds, having 6  8 constant popups of new competitions and offers one after the other again and again and again and again....and again! This significantly extends game time while not playing the game!!! Its infuriating. Let. Us. Playyyyyyyyyyyyyyy.

I spent over 10 grand on this stupid game and over 200 today just to find out there are no more levels left to play. waste of thousands of dollars. waste of 200 that I put on litterally minutes before the end of the levels. stuck with this money cant play game anymore and literally out 200 when I couldnt even play anymore after purchase. waste of money. would love a 200 refund or create way more levels.

omg.. this game is so frustrating. You lose way more than you win. They give you lots of wins to begin with, then your lucky to win 1 in 40 games after that. Crazy. Do not recommend unless you want to spend lots of money on it. Also. Once you get to a certain level, tickets are harder to get and wins become less. I think if you play 1 card you should verse others with 1 card. 2 cards should play others with 2 cards etc

of all of the bingo games Ive played over last decade or 2, one of, if not THE, fairest  well balanced. YOUR personal play style matters, but winnings over time are enuf to keep playing for long stretches, 1 side game even starts just 4 tix (in game ). ones offered vary enuf, you can surely find 1 or 2  any time that you like. Lots of side opps: PvP, avoid the clown, merge, blackout,  more. Light storyline, costumes, clans. If bingo is what you want, highly recommend!

I really enjoyed this game to start with and would regularly win at least once per round. Now, I can go 15 rounds without a single win, regardless of how many cards I play. The ticket cost each round is the same as a bingo, so it is really difficult to increase your ticket amount. Bored of the fixed game, which is now just purely money driven. The cost of buying tickets is offputting as well as its a lot of money for not a lot of tickets.

this is a good way to pass your time, but once you reach a certain level you need a lot of bingo cash. for example you need a minimum of 500 bingo cash to play one card and you can only buy 300 cash for 2,20. Its like the developers are saying dont play this game even if you want to pay

Pay to play. After a while, you spend more tickets trying to play, not getting good power ups in the queue, no bingos, and poor pay out from getting bingos. most of the time, you dont even earn your tickets worth with getting multiple bingos. You spend 80 tickets, and maybe earn 15 back. Even first place bingos sometimes only earn you 10 tickets. Makes it really hard to enjoy the game.

not a great bingo game compared to bingo frenzy, bingo voyage I find it hard to actually get more than 1 bingo in a 4 tile game and often no bingos, therefore you are always behind with tickets and cant play again till the next day unless you want to make a purchase. Other bingo games, you get multiple bingos, jackpot bingos and so forth and stay ahead with bingo tickets, makes it far more enjoyable to play when you can keep playing with out having to always pay to be able to continue to play

I downloaded the game just to have a fun bingo game, not really to win any real money like the ad for it claims (little bit of false advertising there). I deleted it because I was put off by paying to play and not getting any bingos. It sucked all the fun out of it. I redownloaded, thinking maybe it would be more fun and maybe I could get a couple of bingos...I was wrong. I paid over 20 just since downloading and not a single bingo. Not much fun in that.

Unfortunate... This game used to be rewarding and fun. Ive sunk SO much money into this game that Im embarrassed. They will write to join their Facebook for more tickets, but it doesnt offer hardly anything. There is almost no chance of winning. They have bots that respond to you when you ask questions.

This is the cheapest bingo game I have ever played. Its impossible to get enough tickets to play with and when you finally do, you get a minute or so of play time, and even if you win, you cant seem to win enough tickets back to play again anyways. This game is fun for the 30 seconds you actually get to play and then is a waste of space on your phone. Dont waste your time. As soon as the initial credits they give you to start are gone, they expect you to pay to keep playing at all.

this game is slow ti start then it picks up but once you get super high then you cant use star hammers anymore because nothing to upgrade. it is harder to bingo it does not offer any of the rooms it shows in the adds to many people playing the rooms at one time not enough bingos to go around. the side games and challenges are all based on bingos so if you cant bingo you cant win more tickets. even if you top off you dont win that much.

the game getting harder to win these 3 days. ive lost in total of 7M tickets. it is not easy to earn. there are match with 40 balls drops but less than 9 numbers can be daub on your cards. it was enjoyable few days ago but not anymore. Developer please fix your game, everyone is having an unpleasant time here. my level currently 1000, my minimum bet a match is more than 20k and most of the time is 40k to 60k. you rarely win and when you win, its just 50k or 100k but lost million.

When I 1st downloaded the game it was great. I won multiple times but now that Ive gotten past a certain level the game eats up my coins I get hardly any bingos at all and it takes my money away which really sucks. Sometimes the game doesnt even give you a complete round of calls And just says round over after about 4 daubs. I dont like playing much anymore and I will not be recommending it to anyone else.

its a good game  is fun to play but its not clear on what the cost of bingos  money it takes for each card u play  its not giving out enough money  bingos or a daily rewards to keep playing for a hour if that  its cause of not having enough tickets or bingos to use  its only if u buy the extras rewards they offer if u pay for i

Its okay at first, but as you continue, it gets way worse. Eventually, you need way more to actually play the bingo game, and sure, you can do the ones worth less, but the winnings for those are minimal. Theres a required amount of game currency you need to actually participate in events. Im also pretty sure some of the cards you can get for more currency is ai generated.

Was fun and marginally addictive but the higher you go the more money starts to come into play or youll get a couple of games a day nothing more. Really doesnt help when you stop gaining items on the side quests. Yes I could get in touch and get support but its not worth the time and tbh developers shouldnt release games if theyre glitchy.

it is to hard to get credits honestly. it comes down to when you activate everything, you might have enough credits to play one game. if you dont win that game thats it for the day. and then the cost to play that game is to high. if this was not like this it would be a 5 star rating. other than that its a fun game to play

nothing but a scam they rigg it so you loose all the time they seem to conveniently have all other players have the winning cards so that when you play you get 0 numbers on your card that they call out and everyone else always seems to win so that you run out of chips then it says to continue on you need to pay 23.99 for more chips nothing but a money scam

The game was fun in the beginning, but it has reached a point where getting a bingo and receiving the items needed to move forward have become almost impossible. I am reading the live chats in the room and there are many,who like myself have been stuck for weeks. No enjoyment in playing any further,I will probably be deleting the game soon.

Fun until its not. It seems the more you buy, the higher the cards cost. Then you just dont get any bingos. Yesterday I played for a few hours, I had like 5,000 tickets and lost just about all of it because I didnt get a bingo. Its very annoying to play 2 cards and your put in a room where everyone else is playing 4 or more cards. I spent too much money and it just keeps costing more. I started with 20 pack, then you end up having to buy 49 pk, then 99 pk.

I really tried to enjoy it. I got some wins the first few times but since then no matter how many boards I have I often dont get any bingos whatsoever, let alone enough to offset the cost of joining. More often than not Ill only get 2 or 3 spaces filled per board before the bingos run out and the round ends. It feels like a paytoplay game. You have to wait up to 2 min to join a game. Lastly, old men keep trying to message me which makes me uncomfortable.

Really enjoyed this game when I first started playing but the more you level up the more difficult it is to get a bingo. You end up using up all your bingo cash and only get a free amount once a day. It makes you have to spend your own money and even when doing that you run out fast because the further along in levels the more you have to spend to play the bingos.. I had 2,000 bingo cash and wasted all of it and not once got a bingo. It definitely feels like a scam to make you spend money AVOID!

the game is fun enough, however like most bingo games you run out of money to play. the minimum bet amount increases but the winnings dont increase to match. there is too much time between numbers called. Ive never seen a game that doesnt want you to play as much as any bingo game. no forced ads so thats why I gave it 2 instead of 1.

well at 1st great game. got plenty of wins which was good as you then had tickets and could keep playing. Then it goes down hill bad. ticket prices far too high. takes you ages to get enough tickets to even play one game and then you dont get a win so your back to square one. the cards are impossible unless you use your own money to buy tickets, passes etc. critter heist again impossible as you cant play to earn the tokens as you never get enough wins to play, canon powerup never lands on bingo

so Id like to start by saying that this is one of my favorite games I currently have on my device. and probably the best bingo game I have tried thus far. it is kinda frustrating though that once you get past like level 100(idk exactly what level it began) you get to a point where your bet per card goes from 5 to 150 tickets... per card. personally I like to play with 2 cards, and I am sure that this is in attempt to get a player to purchase tickets, id really like there to be bets in between.

I actually love this game, but I cant play it for more than a couple minutes a day. I got to a higher level and the free daily rewards only allow for about 1 game. In order to play more, Id have to spend a minimum of 20 for just one decent round. Thats insanely high for a game on my phone that doesnt even pay out. Its disappointing

This Bingo game is awesome, Way Better than any other bingo game Ive played. I especially appreciate how much easier they make it by having the option for automatic special daubs, but also by flashing any number thats been called on your cards. Graphics are Great, Storyline is amusing, Rewards are more than Fair, and just an All around Awesome Bingo Experience.

Im giving it a 1 only because I feel like its set up for us just to lose. We dont win anything for getting bingo. I usually pay 200 tickets for each card and if Im actually lucky enough to get a bingo they only pay 200 tickets. 4 cards is 800, so if I dont get at least 4 bingos Im losing tickets every play. Other than that I really like the game.

I wouldnt give it any stars, but I had to select one in order to do the review. Do not waste your time on this game!!! Not even if you pay money, can you equal out what you get paid for your bingos. Rarely, you will get enough money from your bingos to equal what you spent to actually play. on a typical round with six cards you will barely make out half of what you spent every single time. thats including when you spend your own money on the game. If you dont pay you might be able to play once

would give it 5 but the rounds of bingo are too expensive and you cant generate free ticket but every 20 hrs and then the round costs more than you aquire. my other issue is once you make an in app purchase the next one is more expensive and then the next and so on, making it like 14.99 for 535 tickets which is absurd

1. there are like 0 male outfits, all of them are for female avatars 2. game feels rigged at times, my luck changed to be horrible once I had to start paying 120 tickets per game, Ill go several numbers without one daub, or one stamp per number when I was getting multiple before. 3. The double bombs at the end always aim so they dont stamp double at all. 4. recipe game is still bad 5. winning is nothing but losing tickets 6. game is so rigged I dont even have tickets to play the lowest bet.

This is one of those games that I play daily. It has multiple side games that keep me interested. Like that I dont have to spend money to play and Im not bothered by dozens of commercials. The only annoying thing is when you get dropped into a Bingo game that has already begun. Wish theyd change that as I always feel cheated when that happens.

I like the game but... everything cost too many tix to play any of the side games. It cost 2100 to play six cards. They do give you 35 tix every day but not enough to play. They have side games but in order to participate you have to bid higher. The only way to do that is to buy tix which is not fun.

I complained about my game and customer service, which took 2 weeks to answer me this last time, basically saying its my fault, and now it wont give me a win. Ive been playing for months and have never lost 7 games straight, taking away all my tickets to play. Had to complain again about my game not working and havent heard back from support since Monday!

its a pay to win version of every other bingo you have played. the cost of the card can be increased to give you better rewards but if you dont have at least 6 cards you wont get daubs. the worst part is that the card is paid for with the bingo cash which in the long run as you advance will increase in cost. easy right just go back to the other levels? WRONG! the cost is the same price on every level, once increased there is nothing you can do but by cheaper cards and plays rewards loose

Definitely avoid playing this game! You used to be able to win,but the developers have consistently changed the game  changed the algorithm so you hardly ever win. Definitely dont spend money because you get duplicate cards from packs  the tickets you receive isnt fair because it costs more tickets to play when your level is higher, yet the pack ticket amount remains the same. The game has become all about taking your money  giving very little in return! Support let your complaint timeout

I really did like this game. Unfortunately, it glitches frequently with not highlighting the called balls. When youre playing 6 cards at a rapid pace, its pretty easy to overlook some of the numbers. Ive deleted and redownloaded the game before and it temporarily fixes this issue. Did this again and it automatically started me at the highest amount of money to wager on a round. Without realizing this, I lost over 2000. Ive spent around 50 of my actual money to get extra game . Frustrating

Do you like watching other people play bingo while not a single number you have gets called? Do you like getting asked to pay for every little extra the game offers? Do you like winning only once in a blue moon? Do you like spending money, only to be punished for it by losing everything you paid for? Look no further, because this is that game! Welcome to Bingo Voyage, where you cannot do anything for very long unless you pay for it! This game is a cash grab, pure and simple. Do not get.

7 daubs in one round. on an upbet. 2 cards, yes, but thats still ridiculous. Total pay to play game. You never break even or win more. i see other people win huge...the only time i ever win or get more than one bingo, if any, is when i dont upbet. but, then you dont win a lot of tickets. Ive tried many different things, bet everything, bet maximum, tried different numbers of cards and upbet combinations. same results. my only wins are 99 of the time when i dont have any tickets to upbet

Days barely getting only single or double bingos and losing thousands of tickets because of no or very low bingo counts which dont cover the cost of the game. 4 cards at 8000 and you get no bingos and be punished for days waiting for a decent payout. I am sure it is rigged to lose. I actually see a pattern in their number calling. If you like the feeling of being frustrated, this is your game. I see most reviews say the same thing.

it starts out great, but as you level up things get worse. the major problem is they dont give you enough tickets but constantly want you to bet almost the max bet in order to participate in any of the side mini games. the minimum bet for me is for example is 4001200 tickets to participate in the mini games 400 is for the 2 cards and it goes all the way up to 6 cards. the max tickets I have been getting is 400 per day. and when you do win it isnt even close to how many tickets you bet

This game was great at first. But, once you get through a certain level you have to spend to win at all, cant win side games unless you bet high. So then you lose all your tickets over about an hour. Also, the boosts dont always work, you spend coins for them, then the game charges you coins to use within the game. once you spend money, you will win for awhile only to continually lose so that your tickets are depleted and you have to spend again to play only to then lose continually.

Like others, it started off great for me, but with each level you reach, the more costly it is to play. Their package offers are ridiculous too expensive and give you hardly any play time. I guess they figure if you buy once, youll buy again and again. They say its random, but they use algorithms that are NOT in the players favor! This game is rigged. If you click on the other players in the rooms, at least 13 of them are at exactly level 2000. Too fishy to be legit. Keep your money

Used to get plenty of bingos done with the game. been playing for long time  its gone down hill the higher the level the more credits they take  then rarely pay out so you can play more than 1x day. Ive spent plenty of my own money too. I just played a game for 3,00 credits  got rewarded 18! 4 cards  out of 28 or so balls called i got 3 on 1  4 on the other.

Usually, around 10 minutes. The game is rigged, you win big when you play low (and by big, I mean you break even, because you cannot win more than you put in. Thats right, a bingo has 1:1 payout), and when you bet high you lose everything in one go (often), or if youre lucky in 2 or 3 games.

Why am I able to predict when I bingo or I dont? Why is it that as soon as I achieve first bingo, the number of balls to call start to drop  often numbers will be called and I will lose 7 or 8 calls in a row? This happens all the time. When I do play a good game, my power ups wont display in a random order and the double doub, single daub, and automatic bingo daub boosters will come last or I run out of time and cant use them. Random cant be predicted, but I am able to.

Unbelievably greedy. Ive never played a bingo game that doesnt give you any puzzle pieces at all at the lowest bet. Every other game will give you at least 1 on 4 cards. The lowest bet is 4 and then it immediately jumps up to 20 with a 5x multiplier. No inbetween. The amount of credits you get is abysmal. You get like 2 when you lvl up. Somehow I got the most bingos Ive ever gotten, got the Best Bingo label, and still didnt even get enough to cover the bet. Awful game.

When you first start off it lets you win! I dont think this game knows what the definition of Bingo is because I NEVER get one. There are a bunch of pop ups to make purchases but why would I spend money o. a game I NEVER win! Who plays bingo and switch the cards EVERY game? Thats cutting the odds right there. Then you go into rooms and have to wait because the game already started! And its not a game of chance because I watch the same people win over and over! RIP OFF!

Game is okay. Rated it just a 3 as being average. Not very difficult to play. It does force you to make decisions about how much to bet and how many cards to play, whether you want to or not. Havent found a way to withdraw money yet, though that was promised before download. If I dont find it soon, I will delete the app.

this is my favorite bingo game and Id give 5 stars but my only critique is, you cant get puzzle peices on the lowest dollar game! its very frustrating coz sometimes I run out of dollars and play on the lowest amount but never get puzzle cards even with bingos! please fix that! its not fair.

Not gonna lie, yes it is a good bingo game but wanting to play and getting bingo cards I dont get a single bingo on while everyone else in the round makes three to four is just straight up frustrating when it happens over and over again. Its not bad it just sucks to play when you actually want a bingo here and there.

All your advertisements make this game seem like its worth playing. however, upon playing and getting to level 15 I have to disagree. Regardless if what the adds say the game play it like, Ive only won 1st place bingo 2 times the entire time Ive been playing considering its hard as hell to win and each level up only rewards you with 2 or 3 bucks. you would think the higher your level is the more you would receive as a reward for leveling up, but no. this game sucks

So far its more creative than other bingo games. Easy to figure out the game play and benefits. Big points to the creators for making it easy to see! So many get that wrong. I do want to know why Im not getting the bonuses that was promised to my other game for playing this one, though.

I loved this game, except that it is a huge money grab, until I played on the highest entrance fee and my cards were full of items. Powerups fizzled out instead of being used, and I lost everything. I had just spent a good amount of money on the game, and I was pissed. I reached out to support, and they didnt reply until 10 days later. They apologized for the delay and then closed the conversation BECAUSE of the delay. Right. Great business practice there, folks.

Obviously, it is a ripped off.. you need to buy tickets for a really expensive amount and lose it all for 23 bingo games. after that you need to top up again to be able to play or wait like forever for a free tickets. not recommended. you will never win like coz everything you paid for will always be a losing end.

This one and Bingo Frenzy were my favorite bingo games out of all the bingo games in the Play Store, but not anymore. I hate both of these games for having a lot of bots. Every time I get the first bingo, I never get another bingo, either on the same card or on another card. Not only that, the higher amount of tickets I get, the less I win the game. It makes me lose every time I play until I lose all of my tickets. I will be deleting this game immediately.

when you start playing, you win nearly every game and increase your levels rapidly. after level 35, the chances for bingos fizzles out and theres so many ads to promote actual purchases. seems like a bait and switch app. Ill be a lot happier playing a different bingo app where players can win actual bingos. losing my interest very fast.

STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME. This game used to be fun and you actually won. Now its just all about money grabbing. No rewards for people that actually buy things. The more you spend the higher the prices go up. bought some tickets this morning. 1 game 1 loss and no tickets left and I may aswell of just set the money I spent on fire. hate companies that make a great game turn terrible because of their greed.

Definitely a fun bingo game; in terms of actual gameplay I prefer it to the other big name bingo app. However, I was absolutely FLOORED when I found myself in a game with someones name being skibidinier. How is that allowed??? Theres no filter for actual slurs or hate speech? This seems like a BASIC BARE MINIMUM for any sort of multiplayer game. So this is a hard pass until they figure that out LOL.

your daily bonus isnt even a tenth of what you need to play a full game, and winning only rewards what you put in, so theres no real chance of increasing your number of game tickets... but if you have money, like lots of it... would it be cheaper just to buy a PlayStation or an Xbox.

Nothing EVER gets done despite the pile of negative reviews. This app sucks worse than a broken vacuum during a power outage. They dont care if youre not happy. They just want whats in your wallet. Heres a new complaint. The helicopter. At least half the time it will drop onto the next number called. 7 in a row at one point for me. Kinda makes it 50 useless, right? Your algorithms are rigged.

I downloaded as part of the mistplay app. I have parted with some cash to get tokens to play with. This game strips you of all tokens very quickly so you cant play any more unless you spend more cash. Not free to play for very long. Once you get past the mistplay challenges just get rid of it. Devs will probably say its random and a game of chance but you cant possibly lose as much as I do with random bingo calling.

so if the developers could find a new way to systematically take all your tickets, coins, and boosters id be surprised. If you hit a double effect, theyll just make it so none of your numbers are dubbed. the cannons almost never hit anything good. You have to hit so many bingos just break even for what it costs you to play the round, that it takes any winnings you received for advancing so fast you can barely play.

not enjoyable. this game was fun in the beginning until you start noticing how it will literally keep you from winning .. by not calling numbers so your daubers wont activate, or it will give 0 covers out of a 160 balls on a cover all. .. same repetitive things over and over .. its calculated, not random play. so sad

The further you get along the more youll end up spending. Then when the game wants to , it will shut a player down completely. The last round playing 4 cards I had 15 blanks in a row, 15 numbers called and not one number to daub. It eventually took me out by an extremely obvious set up. I lost 4 rounds in a row after winning everything else. Im not buying anything, Im just uninstalling the app.

game freezes and shuts down in the middle of a game. this happened twice in succession and takes forever to reload and finding the game has ended and your winnings gone! 911 app shuts down mid game. Upon reopening app, game is over with a banner above indicating every bingo I could have won. Game does not give enough time to take a screenshot for proof of missed winnings and that sucks.

Incredibly hard to get tickets and play more than 23 rounds a day. You level up and get anything BUT enough tickets to keep playing. When you eventually wait a couple days to collect enough tickets to bid on a higher game you get no bingos and no tickets to continue playing with. Not worth it.

Pay to play in a big way, and expensive at that. All the mini games require high bets, and returns are sparse and incredibly inconsistent. If you have a good amount of disposable income for phone games, its pretty fun, but otherwise, after the first few levels, youll maybe get to play a couple times a day without giving them real money.

Cant play without spending  It costs tickets to play a game, but you dont win enough tickets to continue playing. You pay 1 ticket to play, and you only gain 1 ticket when you get a bingo?? I got the first bingo and I earned 1 ticket. What?? So even if you win, you wont get enough tickets to continue playing. Its dumb. They want you to buy more tickets. They want your real money.

At first, the game was great. I won frequently and ran up through the leagues. Then I made the mistake of spending a few bucks. Immediately I stared losing constantly in an obvious ploy to get me to spend more. It costs so many tickets to play each game that unless I spend money, I cant participate in the other sidequest games. Such a shame. I deleted the game after a few weeks.

Great game until you actually have to start using real money to play each game. 4.99, 9.99, 14.99 ...it all adds up quickly and expensively just to get enough coins for one or two more games. The side games feel rigged, especially the one for the cards. There is no way to win all in a group without using real money to purchase them, so there is no way to complete the card task.

This used to be my favorite game until the money grabs started making it impossible to win a bingo that pays any decent amount so you can KEEP playing. High end cards cost 4000 to play yet they offer a 400 package for 20!!! Thats extortion. if the developers loosen up the play for us free to play people then I personally would be more inclined to spend actual money in the game.

Games do not pay out what you buy in for. ie 1 card costs 50 tickets, but a win will pay out only 10. The games also cheat in that Ive noticed games where I am one or two numbers always away from Bingo. Ive also noticed games where it will say one number or one Bingo left for five more balls. It almost like the game picks and chooses the winners ahead of time.

This game is frustrating. you earn money, but piggy bank takes half your earnings. then to get more of the dollars you earn you have to pay real money. Also you pay in like 80 to play the bingo games and dont even earn half that back even though you get bingos. also you see people earning 1,000 but even with double and triple bingos I only got 90  its a joke

Game is rigged. The game knows which numbers you need and deliberately works around them. While other AI BOTS get constant Double and even Triple bingos, stopping you from getting the numbers you need.

the rewards are so little that you cant sit down , relax, and play a while. Even if you spend money, the amount you get is not worth the price. The game seems like it is rigged, and I am pretty sure there are bots in the bingo rounds. It is a useless game and not worth the time or space on my phone

worst bingo app out there. do not play this one you will get 1 bingo out of six cards per game guaranteed. thats it maybe 1 out of every 100 you will get more not worth playing. if you do download its fun for the first day where you will hit bingos and multiples but after that this app is junk

No adds so they have to make money buy you buying tickets. The first 60 levels they give you options to win but ever since I got over level 50 you start loosing imeditly so much that only way to play anymore is to pay for it. Not worth a penny because even when I did pay it last me 30 mins because the game makes you loose. waste of time.

it was fun at first, until you start spending money and not getting any bingos. Required to bet high but the returns are so not worth it. Game just started, before even getting the 3rd power up, already out of bingos. You win once, you lose 10x, thats the feeling of this game. So depressing.

A bit of a waste of time. You never seem to win as much as you bet, even with all the free notes you still dont have enough to play. Youll win a odd line but youll see other players winning doubles, trebles but luck never seems to be in. Got to ask yourself if the people winning are actually players or just the game cheating.

Getting tickets is hard, other bingo games at least give a small amount even if no bingo but this one gives nothing.

why do the bingo numbers they call jump down so fast without calling a number? Edit: Also whats up with this ticket BS in order to play? Your not giving out money and Im sure AF not putting a dime into any game. I really like this game but the aggravation I get just to try to play it is not worth it

I really enjoyed this game in the beginning. I never really received any bingos after about lvl 25. The app wants you to make in app purchases. Very disappointing. I am looking for a bingo app that I can enjoy and play without putting real money in it.

Great game. Pretty even when it comes to losing or winning. I have my own team and we do pretty well. I just saw an ad that said you could win real money and I have never seen anything like that in this game.

Cash grabbing game. It starts you with currency to play then youre constantly losing until either you have to wait days to play again or buy more currency. Constantly forcing in game purchase ads in game also. I gave it some time thinking maybe my luck was just bad but nope! Its garbage.
