love the game but... it costs a lot of real cash to get anything accomplished the developers are charging way to much .the barn fills up and its frustrating can you add a tool shed to store the building materials ? that would help and make the game better. Also maybe a garage sale type thing or thrift shop for Co ops would be awesome. lastly the golden ticket shouldnt revolve around match 3 it should be a collective of helping farming building the quests etc... I hate match 3 stop pushing it.

Truly a wonderful experience, the community is lovely. To pass the time waiting for the materials, you can play match3. Aside from that, it has no bugs, and so many details within the town, its so cool! The game is sorta P2W cuz of all the money you need to spend in order for it to be fun, but honestly I get it, a company NEEDS to make money, which other players dont typically understand. I usually play this during my free time when Im bored, great game! I hope they can make it even better!

Ive been playing this game for many years, and it has always brought me so much peace and joy. I truly love it. The graphics, the ingame elements, and all the festivals are beautiful and amazing. I should also mention that in the past, the festivals used to have more exciting rewards, like beautiful decorative items for each occasion. It was wonderful, and players could even send decorative gifts to each other. Its a pity that these features were removed. Please consider bringing them back to

I downloaded Township via Google Play Games Beta and have reached level 28 in just over a month. The experience is great, but Im disappointed that the recent update claims offline support, yet still requires internet to launch. This limits play during free time without connectivity. Ive progressed too far to quit, but cant fully enjoy it either. Please add true offline support in future updatesit would greatly improve the experience.

I love the game so much but the land expansion is too small and the whole land is so small that its making my townhome choke because the land expansion they are giving is small. They are demanding for an upgrade but nothing new is adding up. when you upgrade there should be at least a new change and the days for the games are too short. They are supposed to do it in such a way that you can communicate with your friends as well so to share ideas on how your township is going on I think that all.

Edited again, Im glad theyve brought back at least 1 decoration a month, but they need to bring back more for those of that play to decorate. Its really not that hard, I know you have the graphics to do it and I know theres plenty of people like myself that would pay real money to be able to get them. Any other players here that feel the same please add this to your review

Township, the best game I ever played. I started playing in the beginning of 2024. At that time things were so so much different. They have had a lot of consistent updates, I personally didnt like a lot of them, but with time it got better. It has a super smooth gameplay, and a kind support team. If you are to get township I recommend joining the Facebook group Township Barn Hop. The coops are wonderful and a great way to connect with others. I hope you download it. Edit: The new updates arbad

As we progress, the land expansion, community building, and factories need hell of an amount of coins, but the coins earned are still on the minimal side. Should be balanced to progress faster or else becomes boring at sometimes due to long waiting!!! The aeroplane shortcut and the puzzle icon in the decoration menu disappeared after the upgrade of this game!!!

Honestly very disappointed with the new update in the match three game. Why did you have to take away all the fun boosters?? The new ones are utter trash no offense but I am sure everyone else feel the same .I miss the swapper and also whats the point of the Shuffler ....does absolutely nothing .Other than that the game is pretty engaging and fun .Just take the new boosters away please.xx P.S Im not sure if Booster is the right word but if you played it hopefully youll get it

This game is pretty fun and enjoyable. It takes a bit long to make stuff, but its acceptable. The only reason I put 4 stars is because the zoo is supposed to unlock at level 24, and I am now at level 26, and the zoo is not giving me the option to restore it. I dont want to lose my progress. Ive tried reaching out via the app but it hasnt worked. Can you please help? UPDATE: Found out they started removing the zoo for users. Great game tho!

it is fun but it takes a lot of people to make a place so you have to make something different with hard to get idols to make the thing you need to make to make something else but it is really fun i wish that the animals would give therestuff faster so I can make cheese and bread faster but also I kind of wish that some of the crops grow faster other than weat so that I can make sugar and bread and animal food but there are also fun things it is fun to play when your bored and its just fun

I like the game, hate how long it takes to build stuff. since its so hard to get materials, I wish you didnt need so many materials to finish a task. some things id love to see.... maybe a cook book.... some place where you can find all the recipes instead of searching for the factory you need. be nice to have that short cut. and in the market id love for it to show how many of the product you already have in the barn. so that way you dont waste your coins.

I love the game system, I loved that you can play it fully offline, but also you can connect to internet to join teams, provide and get help, chat, and too many other cool stuff. The only issue is the resource download, I hope youll improve it in the future by adding a resource download management window so player can choose what to download, and in which order.

I love playing with this app for a few years. However, it would be better if you make the screen icons smaller or merge them all in one icon and still include the airplane icon so there will be fewer screen displays. There should be two options whether the player wants a restart or delete the account so that those who wanted a restart will not wait for 15 days before playing again. The game should also ask for confirmation before spending coins and bank notes. it is the reason I keep on deleting

This is a very interesting game . Ive been playing since 2020. But the new update is not as interesting as the old one. For example, the old game had seasonal mini events that never left you bored but the new version is having the same adventure game repeating only the name is changing... I wouldve rated 5 stars if it was the old version. We cant see our friends who need help. We can only see a small ! mark near their name earlier we were able to see who needs help separately...

Everything is very good even th details and it really feels u r running a real town . I gave it 4 stars bcuz the game consumes time as the level increase it takes more time for the crops to grow and products to produce. For example it takes 12 hrs to build a circus so, u go to any other game to play . And the cash price is also to much compared in real. Even to expand ur land it takes to many things and if u dont have u need to spend some towns money on tht and its way to much i think tht

This game used to be enjoyable, but it has become blatantly predatory. Playrix has removed TCash confirmation prompts and deliberately places spend buttons where misclicks are inevitable, causing players to accidentally waste premium currency. Progress is intentionally throttled to push realmoney purchases, and support offers no meaningful help. This isnt bad design  its manipulation. New players should avoid this entirely unless theyre comfortable being nudged and tricked into spending.

Going downhill. The levels are nearly impossible to beat unless you pay to get more moves. Then the next few games, even the easily levels are harder to beat. Its just getting harder to enjoy. They took away elders which is causing issues in the community. The point system for their key rewards is getting harder to teach. The people in charge are just taking it a bit too far. It was tolerable there for awhile. But not so much anymore. I hope they fix this... Ive been playing for 2 years.

I do enjoy this game. However, i used to play this a while ago I think on another and old device, I had saved my progress AND made sure because I actually spend real money on the game for example, the hover train and the helicopter was something different I cant remember what it was. Anyway, my point.. When I had downloaded the game again, I had lost all my purchases etc. The only thing I had seem to keep was my level and cash. Please help me with this issue developement team!

am addicted to this game  update  used to love this game but it has gone severely downhill. All the little extras are gone and its just not as much fun. The one and only game there is has been made so difficult that its hard to win without spending money. Everything fun has been made just out of reach unless you want to pay. I find myself playing less and less. Very sad. new update Ive had 2 of the small pop up games show...so happy. These are fun, hoping it continues!

I enjoyed Township at first and still like my regatta team, but progress is clearly tied to spending money. Match3 levels feel impossible until you use Tcash, then suddenly become easy. They also removed the confirmation option before spending Tcash, so one accidental tap instantly drains your funds. Add glitches (like unreachable ocean chests), an unhelpful chatbot, and generic tips under reviews in GPlay store instead of fixesand it feels heavily monetized and frustrating.

Want to love it, but prices are too high for in game purchases, and you cant really play and get anywhere without spending money. Some of those match 3 games are way too hard. My 10yo cried bc he was so frustrated and i couldnt beat it without paying multiple times to extend the turn. And Im sorry but I am an adult with a full time job, sometimes I just want to play on my down time I dont want to wait until tomorrow to finish building 1 house  there its no reason if should cost 160

The cost of up grading the barnfactories didnt cost so much. I wish it was easier. I also the puzzleblock games were easied to win without the need to use money for extra moves to finish the levels. The energy part with the story, its annoying that the things cost so much energy to break things. You basically get 2 moves every 3 hrs,  100 energy points  to get to the next point  it costs 49 energy to break things sucks. If arent buying in game things you dont win.

Im not sure if its the new update but it sucks I cant play offline now. Im not someone who likes being constantly with internet so whatever it was , its really annoying. I lost five days because the game didnt let me play if I wasnt online and I also lost my streak (Ive logged in for almost a year). Also, the prizes suck now. Not even after winning the cup or the card collection fulfills you because the prizes are not worth it. No free expansion nor barn upgrade?

I installed this based off the ad game I played while playing another app. This is not even close to the same game I played. Im not saying the app isnt fun or challenging, but if you are expecting one thing and receive something completely different, you end up very disappointed. I think it would be a good idea if you mentioned that what you see is not what you get. But the graphics are good, the gameplay is smooth and the game seems interesting.

It WAS a fun, entertaining game until some time last week (midNov 25) when they did an update,  messed with the games boosters and took away 75 of the product you could collect within the market in 1 visit; therefore forcing you (if desperate enough) to spend your ingame cash to buy more ( of course, if you had no ingame cash, your ACTUAL money). The more I play this, the more ways I see the developers have forced you into purchasing something. GREEDY AHH GAME. Cheats you, too. But Im

I started playing this game recently, I love it while at the same time its frustrating. 1. Website info only details main items. FAQ a waste. 2. In App support has not answered one question its like were not speaking the same language. Ive been figuring things out. I purchased the 6.99 today dollars and tickets. Barn had a notice which stated I could send for items needed to constructionupgrade. I accidentally touched the screen, the ticket went into a draw. Wheres the drawer? Help!

Had this rated as a 5 star as it is a fun community game, yes to really excel it helps to spend some . I spent money weekly but NO MORE. Their most recent update removed a safety feature that made you confirm farm cash spending..there is not other reason for this change other than to screw over their player base and make more money off of misclicks. Im done and they wont get another single cent from me accidently or otherwise. I hope more follow me!

My money keeps disappearing. It has happened 3 times now. Also I hate the latest update. Market changed and now I cant buy what I need with coins anymore. I think Ill be deleting this game. It was misleading from the beginning when the initial game i played was me farming then selling my items at a market. After diwnloading it switched to building a town. Liars from the start should have told me not to play it but I gave it a chance.

The game is a very good one. What makes me love it more is how I get to make my own choice and options in designing and decorating my own city, like its soo fun. My main issue is how expensive it is to spend the money and not the coins, I have no issue in waiting for hours actually. Another thing, please it will be soo nice if they can add night mode to the game so that I can switch between day and night, Id love to see what my city looks like at night. Thank you

its egh. I played this game mostly to get fetch points and I thought It was fun at first but the match 3 game is very hard. the line firecracker you make on the board arent useful on the vinyl disks which makes you loose the level having to restart a bunch of times and then its gets frustrating cause you cant use coins to get extra moves. Ive seen better match 3 games then this with better line firecrackers. But I like the option to decorate how you want your town to be like.

PPS developers should stop updating always now after 2 weeks I updated Ive filled my plane only one good remaining for me to come back within one hour to send off my plane they refused me access it should not be so. we should be able to update anytime we want but still have access to the game and some crops take longer than its supposed to take to make it. sometimes you cannot enter if your data isnt on that should stop as well.

I was enjoying the game, but their latest update has removed MY choice to ask for a confirmation before spending ingame currency. They know how easy it is for people to accidentally spend their Tcash this way, like me, swiping to cut a crop  accidentally swiping the next section too  bam ... youve paid a chunk of cash to hurry along peppers you didnt want. You need Tcash to progress in the game  so many people end up spending real cash to get more because of this. Greedy developers!

I love this game a lot everything is so perfect! But I have a small suggestion: could you add an undo option in the next update? Sometimes I accidentally click the wrong thing and then have to wait for it to complete. Or if I grow a plant or send a train, by mistake the moment I tap on it, the money gets deducted because it speeds up automatically. So please add an undo option.

It said it needed an update, yet when I went to update it, update wasnt an option! It wont let me play it, says it needs to be updated, keep going back and forth! I enjoyed playing it, had a thriving town going, yet I had no choice but to uninstall the game! Sadly when I try to reinstall the game it says the same thing, even though I am choosing the updated version to be installed  I will miss playing this game

My favorite game in the play store right now. Every once in a while I accidentally select something unintentionally or it will have its frustrations just like anything else but it loads well, there are very frequent good game prizes like gems and bonuses. I can play with other Townshippees even if they arent Facebook friends or phone contacts. Every month is usually themed to the current holiday and the outfits for the farm animals I get a new one of every month are adorable and fun to collect.

I use to love playing this game but the creators have taken the fun out of it , the side game use to be different ones now its the same one but with different story lines and didnt worry Id you were stuck on that level on last one your still stuck, then the market is instead one row double which makes it harder it look for what you need.. its harder to get tc , gems as well as clovers for luck so unless u are just playing but I have found myself going from spending over 12 hrs a day to 3 hrs

First of all the game rarely features the minigame where you get to move your character around and collect eggs...etc. This happened once during a month of play. Secondly, the match3 minigame is almost impossible without powerups or ingame cash. Thirdly, you might realise at a point that the game becomes a hard grind till you get bored of it. It will take forever to come close to completing the city if you dont use real money. Despite everything, the game is fun. Try it out.

fun game, however, I recently uninstalled because i started to notice that in order to complete the airport tasks in higher levels, you just miss the deadline unless you use the in game currency which costs money. Some of the products take too long to make, and you can hit it as hard as you want, but you wont complete the airport tasks unless you baby sit the game all day, and have to literally set alarms to to make the requirement. the game is very fun in the early levels.

this is honestly one of my favourite games. Its one of those games I play for ages, then delete for a bit, and then cant resist a bit more playing later down the line. its so comfy to play, and I love the music as well. the one thing stopping you from getting a 5 star review is how the mini games (the ones with the booth near the bottom of the island) are so very annoying to play, but you cant skip them whenever you join back on the game after a while. Id love an option where you can no.

Ive started with a three stars rating because Its when am starting the game. Having played several levels I have noticed that everything is almost perfect but as I continue exploring the game, I wanna make one suggestion there is no bank where we can borrow money and pay later. Since we have several businesses that generate money over time this is possible. In nutshell, please add a bank. Thank you

Township is incredibly satisfying. The graphics are awesome, and the combination of citybuilding, farming various minigames  adventures makes for an extremely nice  varied experience. The huge positive here is the complete lack of ads, which makes playing a genuinely immersive  goodtime. The only real drawback is that the game is highly paytowin (P2W); advancing deep into the game requires patience, or a willingness to pay. If you can handle the slow grind, its a fantastic builder.

The game feels nice to new players but after a few days it just becomes very monotonous and might even start boring you. Clash of clans remains interesting since the user has to think about every attack, but he can attack even if he is unprepared, but in this case everything is a long wait and you have to keep doing the same thing over and over again for a long long time. The game needs some catalyst to move it fast and bring some excitement into it.

have played for a year now and it is a very enjoyable game, you can play on and off and it is good for a past time with all of the mini games and different objectives to hit. i wish there was more decorating options when it comes to vegetation and fencing as i love decorating my town. also enjoy being part of a team as it allows you to get help from others and connect with others who also want to get ahead in the game.

I have a team on here  we have all noticed that the match 3 are now so hard we can verily pass any of them. we are getting less amount of moves on the rounds. we are getting less help material all around.. this game has become a money pit. as you see I have hit a lot of achievements  I play every day. itd be nice if you could cut down how hard it is to pass a round. Raise how many incentives we get. give us more moves in a round. I have been a play member for few years. make it fun not hard

Fun game. Time taken to produce things is a bit too long. A bit slow actually. The option to place buildings according to the players wish should be another option to consider (place them at an angle, rotate all 4 sides to place them facing whichever way looks good). Regardless, I still enjoy playing

I use to enjoy this game but it has become ridiculous. Ive had day after day of this stupid colorful puzzle while others are doing other games. The regatta is near impossible with (other) event tasks that I cant even do so can only do 8 of the 12 tasks . Im certainly not wasting anymore of my money on this game. Took long enough for the current update to happen when others have had it for awhile.

Addicting! I am officially at a point with this game that I can not build my town. In order to build my town, I have to sacrifice my farm because I need those building materials to pay for equipment to complete my buildings. Its frustrating that on the farm, it requires a ridiculous amount of building material, and it just trickles in on the train. Can you please separate the two so I have a chance to expand both. Use coins even to buy enclosures like in the beginning. Ill change to 5!

The barn creates both a challenge and a loss of interest in the game. Using all the building materials against the capacity creates issues on trying to have fun andor constantly grow. Levels 130 you can do free to play, time is required, but it seems more enjoyable. levels 31 the time required is much more and or the need to spend . I realize the company needs  to survive, but the balance shifts I found once past level 30. The actual game is not what the ads portray!

I play this game every day. I really enjoyed the game to begin with. it was fun. I did notice that every one doesnt get to play the same game. We have 3 people playing in the same house and one of them does not get to play the adventure game at all. Since they dont have access they miss out on finishing the card sets. There so called updates makes the game worse instead of better. They make this so you have to spend to much real money to get anywhere on the game. I do not enjoy it as much now.

And there were No Halloween decorations added which was very noticeable. A Night Time theme would be great, along with some added color choices for the roads and walkways. People are bored.

I will no longer play this game. They got rid of a button that protects you from accidental purchases. They want you to spend money by accident and they will not reimburse you. They made it harder to help friends and receive help. They have the same mini game day after day and have been increasingly more aggressive about forcing you to play it. Started out a very fun, relaxing game but has turned into a shameless money grab in a time when money for most is tight.

new changes are awful. its pretty boring now. Updates Dec 2025. New update on the game made it go from bad to worse. They have removed the feature of confirm spending which means if you accidentally touch a box or a product you buy it and dont need to confirm spending. This is to force you to go and actually spend money to buy their Tcash with real money. I am not allowed to call this a scam. The game used to be super chilled and entertaining, I dont find it to be so anymore.

Extremely disappointed the Confirm option has been eliminated for spending Township Cash. Any accidental touch can result in spending cash, especially in the Factories. My setting got changed at some point a few months ago and I ended buying extra boxes. Fixed it and now just discovered the setting that prevented that from happening has been officially removed in the last update. Game play is still fun, but hate that they seem hell bent on coercing players into spending more.

This game used to be great. It had an option to prevent accidentally spending TCash. They did away with it in the new update and now if you accidentally hit a button, your TCash is spent and support will not help you AT ALL, citing internal policy.

I still have the rewards for placing the factories and so on, which shows that I actually built those buildings. Now I would have to buy everything again.

Even Mayor Anniversary avatars are not given as a reward anymore, it is especially frustrating for old players such as myself. These are two of the countless issues I have encountered. Developers should change their strategy, otherwise this game is just another money grab without soul.

The latest update made this gameplay suck. In yet another attempt to mirror Royal Match, the gameplay has been made harder and the dollars dont stretch as far. What has been, until now, a fun match3 game with farming elements that I played daily has become a pathetic money grab. Additionally, my hundreds of powerups were converted to a handful of less beneficial powerups. Im moving from 5 stars to 2 stars. Ive been someone who regularly buys from the game to debating deletion.

It will test your patience. 1 The collection of goods that youve made will vanish. for example: I have collected 5 Eggs just last night but next morning, there were only one left. As far as I know, You cant eat virtual eggs right? 2 The Algorithm is in such a way that you are made to wait, spend money or get frustrated.

Playrix should focus the game on the township itself, not the match3. Their latest update is the worst, they purposely removed the confirmation button to use tcash so players could easily accidentally spend their precious tcash that makes them have to spend more money. This move is proof that the developer, Playrix is a bloodsucking leech for peoples money and they would do anything to get more and more money out of you. This game could suck a lot of money and time out of you.

For suggestions, I think it would be more visually appealing if there were WEATHER CYCLES, like rainy days, stormy weather, or winter. And I think it would be cool if it had a DAY AND NIGHT cycle. So far, I love this game! It keeps you engaged with the tasks, but I sometimes find it hard to finish other tasks and challenges, especially in the match3 puzzle game. It obviously requires you to spend Tcash.

Good game. 12172025: I could have sworn that there had been a setting that would make you verify your choice before spending Township cash so that you wouldnt just accidentally click and spend it. But its not there anymore, if it ever existed. I think it existed, though, because Ive never made this many missclicks in all the years that Ive played this game. For example, I recently wasted 6 cash to rush a single crop.  Anyway, I miss that setting.

Hello, I have been playing this game for over five years. I stopped playing two years ago and recently returned, but I was disappointed because the old nostalgic feel is missing. Earlier, player profiles showed longterm achievements, and there were many fun events like Sheeple Chase, Bubble Gum Festival, Roller Coaster, Snow Ride, Space Challenge, and more. Now, the Match3 event repeats frequently, some levels are too difficult, and features like the Zoo and event calendar are missing.

For a while there was nothing really new and exciting being added to the game. Then some crackhead got put in charge of the graphics and mini games and over the past year has released what I can only call an abomination.

You can level up and get money just by playing the match 3 levels, helping your teammates, filling out orders etc. Ive spent a few bucks on the game for the season passes because i think theyre fun, and they do get me a little ahead in the game but they are not necessary purchases.

If you accidentally misclick now, you could spend all of your money to produce a crop immediately. All of the fun of the game is eliminated having to be incredibly careful of where you click in your town so that you dont spend your hard earned money on a misclick.

in a place like this we dont have to spend money. but I want to. you dont stay stuck for too long. the tech recognizes that you are stuck and eventually does give you that break you needed to get moving on. get on a good team and it becomes very welcoming. there are different aspects make sure you stay on top of them all.

Beware, this is a predatory game. Its supposed to be a town building game but they force you into hours of unrelated puzzles to progress. The puzzles are rigged to constantly fail unless you purchase boosts. Lots of ads pushing for microtransactions. End chests in events are impossible to reach goals go from needing 800 and the next level you need 5,000 to progress. The events are short few days so even grinding you cant reach the final chests which contain the real value. Money grab game.

Ive had this game since 2017 and watched it go from a really good game to a money grab. I stopped playing for a while because of that and the overall quality has just declined. 1. There used to be a bunch of mini games, now this 3 match for ALL the seasons just isnt cutting it! 2. The seasons used to be 30 days now they cap at 21 days. 3. The prizes in the regatta are ok and cost more than they should. The game is free but to have any progression in a reasonable time frame you have to pay.

Its an okay game. Biggest complaints would be the Tcash. Not enough coming thru, 1 to 30 in cash depending on what youre doing. Paid for the market guy, yet you can only use him once an hour. You lose hours and days, because of life outside the game, so you cant pause the market guy, so money lost there. I have over 2 million in coins, yet cant use some to convert it into Tcash to help build up the town. That part definitely should be fixed, should be able to use both for the town build.

I really love this game and have been playing for years. What is not cool about this game is that there have not been updates to materials for buildingpaving roads etc. There are no additional choices in decorations for your town either. This game will reach and end point once your town is fully developed and there are no more fun things to work towards. Items should not be so expensive that we cannot buy them either. Please make updates to the decorations and roads and concrete pavers.

This game wants what Hayday has, but the charm is overrun by the generic, city aesthetic. It feels much less cozy, like it lost the vision in trying to combine city simulators and farm simulators. Like someone with money saw Hayday and was like: I can do this, but with upgraded graphics while also making it a city sim. Also, I might be losing my mind, but are the cows vaguely blackcoded? IDK, Im a white guy, so take it with a grain of salt.

I love this app so much, its relaxing, very detailed, and you can tell the developers put a LOT of work into it. i never review apps but I genuinely love this app so much, I hope this can convince you to give it a try  Even tho you have to wait for the crops to grow and your products to be ready, i believe its teaching me patience and the real value of time. I used to just delete apps of similar nature but theres something so incredibly rewarding about watching your little farm grow :)

I love the premise. Has multiple games to keep things interesting. However, side games never allow enough time to get to the end of the story. What Im not fond of is that to make real, fast progress you have to spend an enormous amount of time and money. If you dont mind spending hours or days waiting for things to grow or build, then this game is for you. Luckily, time is something of which I have an abundance.

I have 3 buildings Im waiting on, and in the meantime the barn is full of building supplies and I cant pick up anything to load train cars or fill orders unless I sell some of those, and yet I dont have what I need to expand the barn. This would not be an issue if the building supplies were subtracted when you placed a building instead of when the building was finished. On the side quest, I took 3 steps, and Im out of energy, and on the match 3 I dont have 10 dollars to buy more moves.

This game was so fun at first. The higher you get the longer you stay stuck. You cant build all the new level buildings, one, they get way too expensive and then two, completing them isnt as easy as trying to collect enough coins to purchase them. By the time you get all the materials needed to complete them, its way past time to build another. The barn wont hold what you need without expanding and you cant get enough materials to expand!

This game is very addictive. But the thing that will make me lose interest is that as you level up, it takes longer and longer for your crops to grow and your factories to finish making items. By level 23 you will be waiting 1.5 hrs for yogurt, 2 hours for a pizza or potato chips,  4 hours for wool. Also they make it hard make more money. No ads, but they push you hard to buy more game money. Shorten the wait times  make it easier to earn game money so people will keep playing your game!!!

this was an amazing game however the developers have become extremely greedy. every update makes the game less fun practically forces you to spend real money if you want to partake in everything the game has to offer. I had no problem spending the 4 for the pass every 20 days but now with the increase in energy cost during the adventure game, its almost impossible to finish unless you spend money or play 247. the game went from 5 stars to complete money grab. its a shame.

I used to play a few years ago and stopped because an update lowered needed build material rewards. I hate micro transaction games that think you should spend your rent on their pixels. Dont know why theyre falsely advertising, but the gameplay they show has nothing to do with the game. And Township is very much pay to build. Resources are unbalanced and lacking, storage always full. Unique buildings pay only.

I have figured out why the matching game seems so difficult. The game does not account for all of the obvious hits on a target. I have seen it several times. I hit a target with 6 missiles and only 2 are registered. It does in fact steal moves. That type of coding is considered unfair and even a type of cheating and theft, because it nearly forces a player to buy power ups using real money. What a shame to know that the world has come to this on something as simple as a game of leisure.

I love everything about this game. This is the first game in my entire life that actually got me to want to buy stuff with real money lol! The only thing I really really despise and hate is that when you (accidently) tap on purchasing more space to create in a factory, it has no confirmation button so it immediately deducts from your towncash.. And since that button is extremely close to the x to exit the factory, it has happened to me over 3 times which really sucks.

Very addictive game! You can see through the gameplay how it was designed to push you into buying things for real money. Very often, finishing a hard stage is one move away from completion, but if you had boosters, you would finish it, if you know what I mean. So why dont you buy it? Hahaha. I do understand that the creators of the game must gain some profit. Its a good game, but be careful not to get drawn in! THE OPTION TO CONFIRM ANY CASH SPENDING DISAPPEARED AND YOU END UP LOOSING CASH !!

Gems that were earlier rewards in Regatta, events, and the game pass have almost disappeared, reducing player freedom with boosters. Coins also feel very scarce now.

Great game. Very addictive, you can spend far too much time on it. Would have given 5 stars, but 1 star was deducted for false advertising that I hate! The ad shows planting crops, feeding animals, upgrading tractors, and serving customers, etc. Whilst the game is on a similar theme, the format is entirely different. Something fractionally like the ad is thrown in on rare occasions and plays for about 30 seconds! Quit false advertising! Grrr!

Game is enjoyable but a recent update removed a feature that prevented accidental use of town cash. Reached out to support but they only offered a generic response that acknowledged the removal safeguard but no solution.

Issue with chest not opening. Took away the notification to tell you if you are spending t cash accidentally. Money grab and greedy. The only way to get through the hunt is energy points earned in Match 3. Need another way for those who dont play Match 3 a lot. I have been playing since May. I have 6 family members now play. We like it. Good for young kids and adults.

love this game. my only complaint, would be the fact that you cant rotate the map to see the back sides of were buildings and stuff replaced so you can place other things or really just get a full 360 view of the entire map that youre working on. but still thats not enough for me to give it less than five stars, because out of all the games I played and play with it for money or not, this game is where its at! ... fyi: in case you misunderstood what I voice texted, this game dont pay.

Im VERY put off by the fact the company charges you more for in game currency if you already spent money. I had a Black Friday offer for 23.99 while many others had 3.99, 8.99, etc. Def not spending anymore money, but I wouldve kept spending small amounts here and there, now they get no money. edit: 1 star now because they intentionally REMOVED the confirmation button when spending paid currency AND they made the Match 3 mini game HARDER so I cant progress!! LISTEN to your players!!!

They have completely destroyed this game. They removed all side games, changed the match game by removing the help tokens you earn. Now you have to collect cards and the gold ones are impossible to earn. Ive played this game for 6 years and just stopped due to how unplayable this game is. Although it is free, they have changed it so much you have to pay in order to reach any goals. The game is out of Russia and had a lawsuit because of false advertising. Id recommend uninstalling.

I love playing this game. I have been playing for about 3 years now and have had minimal issues. That was until today. I used my game cash to expand my factories and had 1201 to use. after just adding a few spots to my existing factories, I went from 1201 to 575. That is WAY too much cash missing from just a few uses. To my Township developers, my I have at least 400 game cash added back? I have spent a lot of money on this game and dont want any stolen from me

I have been playing this game for several days now and it never gets less frustrating. Some levels take so many tires to beat that it has me ripping my hair out. As someone who is a masochist Im pretty sure if my dominant told me to beat 10 levels of this game, I would cite the 8th constitutional amendment. The concept of the game is fun, dont get me wrong, but the levels are either way too easy or difficult, and dont get me started on how badly programmed the helicopter booster is. Aughh!!!

Please save Township!! I used to love this game and played every day for years now I barely play it at all. I came back today  the game is so cluttered  disorganized! I wrote a review a couple of years ago  the game is worse now. I used to worry about saving my progress, but now, as much as I like the little farm animals piggy,sheep,cow,chicken, etc . , I dont care about progressing in the game anymore. This once fun game has been turned into a weird jumble of whack.

Its a very nice game, but my one nitpick is that you are always required to play regattas. because the minute you dont play, youll be demoted to another league. I dont see why I should constantly be playing regattas. I would also like to focus on building my town. if something can be done about this, Ill be grateful.

They messed this game up. They give the same prizes over and over whether its the regattas or side games. Same with holidays when they want you to purchase decorations. How many of the same thing do you need? I dont want or need 3 or 4 monster trucks or singing vegetables bands. Many side games or the rooms are impossible to finish. The games give you bare minimum points yet room fixtures take hundreds. I have not finished any rooms or Professors experiments. The match 3 has impossible levels

Theyve updated this to make them more expensive in an update and its unclear why. The newest update also removed tcash spending confirmation, so you can ACCIDENTALLY spend money in the app. Wont be worth having this game unless they adjust how theyre doing their updates. Edit: Support has worsened. You cant talk to a person at all. I reported an issue and robot asked for a screenshot and theres no way to opt out. So I tried uploading and it kept failing and now I cant even report that.

why would anyone want it snowing in the game when its snowing irl ? the update is stupid and makes the game worse. levels in the 3 match game are made impossible to win. its not a matter of strategy or difficulty, its purposely made impossible to advance until youve played the board a number of times which makes it frustrating and stupid. Also, forces you to claim unlimited lives reward weather you are able to play at that time or not. its ridiculous. uninstalling. dont waste your time

Frustrated with this app since their last update. It completely benefits the companygame and not the player. They removed the Township cash confirmation feature. I cannot be the only one accidentally clicking or tapping on things that used to make you confirm the purchase...now it just assumes I meant to click that and there goes the township cash balance. It is weighted to benefit the company. I used to spend money on this game. Not anymore. They had that feature, and now they dont.

what used to be a five star game, has become a lot of trash. Building the city is great. But the regatta rewards are trash, the side adventure stories can be fun, but the horrendous amount of energy needed is ridiculous. The puzzles section is not only frustrating at times, but also really boring. A lot of it feels like a cash grab. This current event is the worst Ive experienced. The amount of energy required is a bad joke for such minor rewards. Why are you purposely trying to ruin the game.

Do you like jewel games? Cause thats what this game is. Wanna get coins, cash and items? Well you have to play the jewel game. This is just a jewel game with a farm side game. Even worse, you cant win the jewel game in higher levels without spending cash. But you cant progress fast without the jewel game. It is maddening!

The graphics have changed heavily and they are bubbly and cartoonish and take up a lot of screen real estate. The power ups have changed. 1 was split into 2, and the most useful one changed to a shuffle. You used to be able to complete tasks to gain energy for the adventure game, which is repetitive, but now you can only get it by playing match, which is incredibly boring and repetitive. Theres no redesign elements. And apparently the zoo is going away at some point. I barely sign in anymore.

Tcash confirmation is gone. Ill rate 5 star when it comes back. Recent update the settings menu changed, I can no longer find the option, require confirmation when spending Tcash. taking this setting away just makes it more obvious how money hungry this company is. I spend money in the game, and I want it to be intentional, accidentally spending Tcash is too easy to do, and thats unacceptable. If its not fixed soon Ill take my money to a different game, theres plenty out there.

I have a question about music that was played during the Noir Detective The Mystery of the Emerald Rose. It was in the area where you have to use points from match 3 to get your character further. There was JazzBlues music and it had lyrics that came on when you got to a specific area. The lyrics start off with The moons a sliver in a velvet skyline, lights through the blind whisper, drifting by shadows, dance where secrets are born, a tune in my tattered heart... I have looked everywhere.

I actually enjoy this game. To be clear, I only downloaded this game to earn points for gift cards through the Fetch app. This is the ONLY game Ive enjoyed from that. There are no video ads, off topic ads, and anything real world money related is for the game through the game and isnt an incessant pop up. You also dont have to play match3 to level up, it just makes it go by faster. I even ended up joining a coop and making friends in the app. I might not delete it when I hit level 50.

Great game  incorporates creativity, challenge  socialization. Fantastic artists  script writers. Match 3: creativity is great, but the mechanics are by far the worst Ive seen as an og M3 player. This is the only version where boosters have actually made me lose. Clearing too much of the board w a powerful move shouldnt fail you! It also hinders strategic moves like sending 2 rockets to double hit an object. Additionally: too many unchecked hackersbots. (edit 2)

Epic game! I love to play farming games and games from you Playrix, and after discovering this game, I really wanted to play it. And after playing it for a while, I really enjoyed it! I also love how theres no annoying ads popping up everywhere, instead theres so many app purchases . Also, you should have added the Play Games achievements sooner. I could have unlocked almost all of it when I played for the first time.

I played this game from 1619, and I came back in 25. The game has changed drastically. The customer care service is very poorI contacted them two days ago and still havent received a reply. The match3 gameplay is very disappointing, and I feel players are getting tired of it and leaving because of this. Old events are gone, and now we get the same repeated events every week and month. Earlier, events were connected to regular town activities,but now everything revolves around match 3 game.

Things start off fine but then everything takes time. The match 3 game is so hard even Candy Crush would scream. Then you removed the option of spending town cash, the one good thing going for this game. I just spent what little town cash I had by accident. before there was a pop up to ask if I was sure. Id have declined immediately. now I have nothing, and you guys barely give any town cash in the first place. Giving 2 starts bcz I like looking at the city I built, if not, 0! FIX ASAP!

I like this game but as soon as you continue to play the game , the time to wait for things is insane. Im on level 32 and having to wait for a train for 5 hrs and buildings for 2 days is crazy. It takes hours to make products and by that time Im already forgetting about the game and lose interest. ok level 35 now and this is beginning to get boring. Having to wait hours  days for things to build  crops to grow is definitely boring. The match game has also become boring and repetitive.

Not bad. but Im going to complain about one that got me pissed off on the app, all my savings went straight into piggyback without my consent which i find interesting at first. But anytime i tried breaking the piggyback after 6days and hrs given it always disappeared. Unless i used extra money to open it which is not fair, why save in the first place if am going to have too removed my saved Town cash with another money. Thats absolute joke to be sincere.

Pretty decent game, the building and stuff is actually pretty good and you tend to use up all the materials you produce. solid 78 out of 10. the only issue is the 3 match games, winning relies on luck not skill. also you will ALWAYS END UP ONE MOVE AWAY FROM WINNING THE MATCH. or if not one move less than 5. kinda pointless if the goal is to just keep playing the same level only to lose due to mechanics. Also I feel like its built that way to encourage spending money for extra moves.

I enjoy Township for a long time, but one issue keeps happening. On my PC the game updates, but on my mobile it keeps saying Update needed! even though no update appears on the Play Store. Its been days and this problem happens often. The game asks for an update before you upload it to the store. Please release updates on all devices at the same time. This delay makes the game unplayable and very frustrating

Good game in my opinion. Yes, it can be frustrating to wait but for a free game its totally fine. And yes, match 3 games can take sometime 10 times or more to pass but still for a free game its completely understandable. To me its quite enjoyable and interesting so far at lvl 44 and match games over 1100. And Im reasonable enough to understand that this is someones way to earn money and yes as you progress its going to be more and more challenging and that is ok.

I have been playing this game for over 11 years. Never have I had an issue with ingame purchases.....until a few days ago. I purchased 2 separate Tcash packages. My bank was charged. I received the Tcash, and the very next day it disappeared putting me back to prepurchase tcash total. Ive reached out to support  only get a bot. So, youve basically stolen my actual cash  the tcash I purchased. Are there no live support agents? I need this resolved.

Game could be great but its basically a money grab. It takes forever to just make it to the next town level. When you earn cash, it gets locked in a piggy bank for some reason, as if you didnt earn it. The barn is ALWAYS full and requires huge amounts of cash. Ive bought 2 packages and the rewards are pretty lame. The game forces you to play candy match which makes no sense!! Is I wanted to play candy crush I would open that app. So much promise yet such a disappointment....

4 years ago it was a fun game, that can never be said about it again. They removed so many personable things i.e. no more decorations, and is just a pay to play game now, there is absolutely zero point to play. They even stopped giving you a free avatar picture for your yearly anniversary of playing the game. WHY?! I cannot stress enough to warn you to NEVER play this game. complete waste of time. They will never stop until they rip every cent from your hands.

township they make it hard to get extra cash without buying cash. no game reward anymore Its like they want you to buy cash to pay for extra moves in the hunt. It starting to be a money thing so when you have cash you have to watch cause you push button accidentally buy something you didnt want to. without an option to cancel it so annoying most games ask do you want to buy or cancel this. it be nice to change by asking if you want to buy this.

Negative feedback for deception in game advertising. Game advertising shows one game, and when you download and install the game, it is different. Game advertising shows an interesting action game, where the player directly controls the game hero, and when you install this game, you actually get a standard strategic, tactical game, which the Google Play platform is full of and they are fed up with. I would not have installed such a game. Stop deceiving users.

I loved building the town, amd played for a few months, but the side games they MAKE you play to get power ups and to advance got frustrating. I think they rig it sometimes, so its too hard, and youre practically forced to spend money or wait FOREVER. By that time, you really cant win everything because the time limit is over. I had to delete it because it got too greedy and not fun anymore. Dont waste your time. Its a money pit.

Editing my review to say this game is a SCAM.The match 3 game says rewards will be x10 and x5 on some levels but when you complete them you just get normal rewards.Some levels are also RIDICULOUSLY hard  Ive tried 1 level 20 times now, used up all my lives (twice!), boosters, specials etc and refuse to pay for more when Ive already paid for aspects of the farming game.The game hooks you in then all aspects get ridiculously hard once youre invested and rely on payments to progress. AVOID!

Fun if you dont fall for the attempts to make you want to pay. I play games online to relieve stress  boredom. I would rather play alone not with others cuz then it becomes obligatory.

I have lost all interest in this game! I first played this game in 2015 and stopped playing around 2023 because I had other things to do, and now when I came back the game got miserable. I dont understand how the playrix team thought it was smart to remove the zoo feature, it was one of the best things in the game and you guys took it away. This is what I dont understand about most companies. They wanna make new changes but in reality they just kill the game by removing the good stuff.

In the past I would probably have given it 5 stars. I feel like within the last 2 weeks the match 3 had been almost impossible all the sudden to win without power ups and spending dollars. I feel like I order to be competitive and complete the regatta tasks and you have to have match 3 and spend actual money. To buy the passes and pay for bonuses and get dollars. The game is becoming more aggravating than fun.

You cant get actual help. They want you to waste time playing with their chatbots and ultimately they do nothing. Bonuses like barn expansion stop working. If you pay and work within the game it doesnt work. Solely a money grab with everincreasing costs and decreasing results. The side games are impossible to win. I had multiple factories and alwaysalwaysran into shortages that shouldnt have happened. The developers only give the same cut and paste nonresponse. Fraud.

this game was fun but now the only mini game the game offers is basically candy crush. I am probably not going to continue to play if the other mini games do not return. they chose the worse one and just keep it running that was why the game was good. my advice there are other games that arent straight boring because the only thing to pass time in this game is match 3 and we all know candy crush lost its touch years ago.

I always play until fed up. The match always unable to pass. The barn storage always full. The material takes long hours to complete. Once earn the money, it very fast collect from anywhere, always cannot accum more. The ship need longer time to return. To solve this I guess we need to subscribe and continue the game.

Got a popup window asking for feedback. Heres the feedback; stop stealing ingame cash that I paid for with my real, human money. Its otherwise known as stealing!!! Popularly against the law!!! I gave a review TWO years ago with the same feedback. Came back out of curiosity, and the exact same thing happened again. Tcash that I paid for disappeared with no paper trail of what happened. So, even if its a glitch, theyve refused to fix it.

BEWARE! This game is built against the player from the start. Expect their algorithms to flat out cheat against you while they try to coerce you into spending your hard earned money. just when you feel like youre making progress they cheat and pull the rug out from under you. I promise youre going to get pissed off and clearly see how they cheat. There is NO customer support. You get a retarded bot that takes you in circles. They just want your money, nothing else.

Fun game, with different playable options. It has the usual farm base with challenges, then a story mode which changes frequently where you advance by either waiting for the timer to add to your power bank or complete a block type game to clear your pathway. All in a great designed game thats always updating, with online groups you can join to get extra gifts.

I have been playing this for 8 years. It used to be fun and challenging, but not too frustrating. Now its just a cartoony, moneysuck that is so hard, if I were a new player Id give up. Gone are the fun, challenging minigames, replaced by (how amazing) match3. Repetitive and boring adventures have replaced room decorating events. There used to be a zoo to build and fill with decor and animals, but half the players had it taken away. Dont waste your time with it!

Trust me, if you want a farmingtown game this isnt it. This has become a match 3 game. I have played this game since Covid when we were all at home. The basic game is fun. But, in recent years, they have made it 90 about the match 3 game. It has become all about money grubbing for this company. I HATE how it has been ruined. Players keep asking to return this game to the OG farming and town game, but they ignore us.

Bring back double confirmation to spend town cash. I love this game so I spend a little bit of my real life money to buy ingame cash to make the experience more fun. There used to be the option for double confirmation to spend that ingame cash. THEY REMOVED IT. Skeevy effing move. It absolutely ruins my enjoyment of the game when I accidentally spend like 5s worth of my own money with a misplaced tap. Bring double confirmation back and Ill adjust my rating.

Takes money to do anything. The barn is always full, takes forever to do anything. The side games take money to beat. If you have cash be careful when pressing buttons, it doesnt ask if you want to spend it prior to just using it, so if you are moving fast, you can spend cash, even if you dont want to. Just a cash grab game. If you dont mind waiting and letting it just sit and go back to it after awhile, its a distraction.

This game was entertaining until town level 25 and around puzzle level 500. The game slows way down and the more and more the game requires their in game money. Unless youve saved every single in game money be prepared to spend real money, and not just a little, or be willing to watch your game come to a screeching halt. The puzzles are especially frustrating as they start becoming less and less about strategy and more about getting you to use up all your boosts. Level 674 has stopped me dead.

I would give this a zero stars! It was great to begin with, the tasks were challenging and exciting. Playrix have removed more and more rewards and this new fashion pass is ridiculous. Before you got to see how many tasks to achieve to reach the next level. They have now also changed the boosters and they are even worse! Each time you play a game, you only get given ONE KEY! So theyve made it 10 times harder and force you to buy more purchases! I have seen many reviews at one stars recently.

you wont enjoy playing the match levels if youre not willing to pay; they become much easier if youve spent money on the game. its a pretty obvious and really irritating aspect to the game. the game doesnt give you enough cash and items to actually build anything in a decent time, unless of course...you spend actual cash!! aka major cash grab, avoid if that bothers you. EDIT: dropped down to 1 star because the devs have continued to remove aspects e.g. double train carts, its getting worse

I paid money to get ingame cash for extra turns but despite having the gold ball (doubles the power), a full set of power up, and buying 5 turns more than 4 times until I ran out of in game cash, I still couldnt pass because the game wouldnt put out the peices that needed to be broken to pass the level.

Had to edit my review. After a while, it becomes pretty evident that this game is completely rigged. No skill can get past the impossible match 3 levels that it throws at you over and over and over again. If youre looking for a game to throw money at, this game will suck it straight out of you. Luckily I only spent some saved up playstore credits. the difference in progression when paying compared to not paying is insane. AVOID.

If you play just with the farming aspect and not play the match 3 game or do anything that requires township cash, you may like it. The match 3 game can be pretty impossible without spending TS cash. They are always updating the game in order to make more money off their players. I am pretty sure the developers come up with ideas to get us to buy TS cash, but give us less reward, and try to gaslight us and call it improvements and exciting updates. It use to be much better.

Played the main game for an hour and got one mini game. THIS game reminds me of Farmville. Got boring quickly.

Unauthorized use of tcash.. I have the additional setting indicator initiated to require approval to use tcash to avoid incidental spending. THREE times its spent 10 from incidental pressing although I have the function activated. Tcash is purchased using real cash, thats totally a scheme and its not fair. Makes me not even want to continue to contribute to the game.

Township is a terrible game that wastes your time and data. I started playing this game in 2018 and reached level 85, but now my entire data has been deleted by the game developers Disappointing aspects  Game developers deleted my entire data  No support or help available  Those who dont want to waste their time and data  Those looking for a good game  Those expecting support and help  I would not recommend this game to anyone

please dont be offended but I loved, Farmville and we are all aware your wonderful game is nothing like it but farming in these games makes it so much easier to fall head over heels in love with you, Township dont stop making it better maybe offer more cash in the mine, thats where I think I have spent the most! And I cant thank you enough for getting and THANK YOU for providing such an absorbing game I can train my mind to!

if you are not already locked in, DONT START. You have to update so often it takes up over 3g of my space on my phone. with monthly if not weekly updates that are mandatory. its the same tasks and rewards every week. every update seems unnecessary over the last 6 months. please, I beg you, stop making the update mandatory. I can not take up more space on my phone.

Hate the new updates. Its so easy now to lose your town cash now that theyve taken away the option to confirm whether you want to actually use your cash. Constantly accidentally clicking on things because theres a delay at times in the games and it freezes so your town cash quickly dwindles down but hey maybe that was the plan and idea behind removing the feature!

It seems that with each update changes are made to make it nearly impossible to play the game without spending real money. Taking away the feature to confirm spending Tcash is one of the worst changes. And the Match3 game is getting ridiculous!!! I am about ready to delete Township. It used to be fun, but is no longer.

DONT download it. This game is a huge scam and has bugs that suddenly make you spend your ingame cash on the wrong thing, and you cant undo it. Also, whenever you finally have enough cash for an upgrade, the game somehow becomes unplayable unless you spend that cash to keep playing You think the support will help? Keep on dreaming.

Typical predatory monetization. If you are a free player then you will enjoy till township level 10, that is when they grab your invested time hostage by introducing the piggy bank. Once that is introduced, it will lock away your subsequent ingame earnings of town cash that can only be unlocked by paying RL money. I can understand the developers motivation to earn money, but holding the freely earned ingame currency hostage behind a paywall, is just another level.

Ifyou are looking for a SimCity type game, keep looking, this isnt it. Uninstalled after the mini game was the exploding blocks game AGAIN. Wouldnt be so bad if the second level wasnt the one you couldnt pass the last time (3 days ago normally) without spending real money. The same procession of games and no real progress.

why pull a bait and switch? if you have a game that people clearly want to play enough they click an ad to install it why download a completely different game! so frustrating! I didnt agree to this game but the one showed in the ad. Waste of my time and completely disingenuous for the company to do that. what you think we arent going to immediately uninstall a game we didnt want in the first place?

The farming game itself is generic. Its just another farming game where you have to wait several hours to days for your plants and food to produce. When it comes to the puzzle part its horrible. Id swipe and sometimes it would make me move the other way. This entire game is a p2w, but the puzzle part is so blatant about it that for some puzzles its impossible to move forward unless you pay for extra moves and have powerups. I had 200 because I won the puzzle thing; 2hrs later it became 0.

well, it started off promising. Good way to kill boredom, no ads, and a bit of variety in there. Unfortunately, it very quickly becomes a greedy, disgusting money grabbing game. The puzzles from lvl 200ish onwards, for the most part are all designed to make you fail so you purchase ingame currency to use extra moves and finish them. One level that sticks out is 279; it is literally impossible with breaking out your credit card. Ill be avoiding this studio from now on. Disgusting.

Slow and boring! Played for a few days to gauge its enjoyment! Once the initial cash and coins are used up, it basically ends up a match 3 game. Waiting hours for an extra life to continue the game which is virtually impossible to win and get to the next level. That is unless you want to spend a fortune to buy cash, lives and other stuff. I got to level 67 but ran out of interest and patience in playing . Would be very concerned if kids used this with the amount of purchases..

They just removed the feature to confirm spending cash within the game. The buttons to spend cash are placed so you accidentally press the button. Support refused to refund, and refuses to address the issue by putting cash spend confirmation back. Additionally, in match 3, its getting more and more complex, to the point of not being fun, and many levels require you to spend cash to complete. Awards have gone sharply downhill.

frustrating game ...they are just after money ...their target audience are the kids who have no value for their parents money or people who spend an unreasonable amount of money to move further in this game ...it keeps you waiting on some task so long that it becomes irritating and you just uninstall it like I did ...it worth playing once in a year where you are travelling or killing time and you have nothing to do ...so I am gonna install it on my next train journey.

The only thing I will say is, this game is not what was advertised. I installed this game after playing the advertised version but soon found out that its NOT the same game. Although the game has some depth to it and it doesnt force you to spend real money, thats good. The game is quite repetitive but doesnt feel forced.

I have the Play Pass which gives me access to PCconsole titles (most of them questionable mobile ports) and Township is still the game I spend my time in. Farm, manufacture, match, race, fill airport and train orders, mine, create boosts in the Laboratory, and so much more. It is a good, wholesome experience. If youre feeling burnt out and drained from having to battle against others or be the last one standing, why not try something more calming and productive?

This game is really slow and next to impossible to make any good progress without spending a bunch of money. you will win one or 2 maybe 3 levels in a row then unless you have 10(game money that costs real money), you will have to give up your bonuses and power ups. Its the frequency of how often this occurs that shows this game is a cash grab. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY

Seems to be the only way you can win levels and have a better gaming experience by spending actual money on the game. The fact it can take up to 20 times to beat one of the gem levels is absurd to me. I like playing but it gets old when you cant get anywhere because, again, Im not spending real money on the game.

All mini games discontinued  all games are now only related with puzzle game. now its not town making game or renovating game but its become only puzzle game. if the developer wants to create a puzzle game then he can create another one or theres already gardenscape, then why the same thing done with township. its become too irritating game now a days, since puzzle is involved in more than 5 games at the same time  township grace working games discontinued.

Every aspect of this game that was enjoyable has been removed and replaced to revolve around a single game that wants you to continuously pay money to succeed. Any achievement you make is for that game which ruins the fun of building your town. There used to be different games and prizes for your town that made you want to play and continue to build it. DONT BOTHER!!!

Its been a while since I played a game where pay to win was this bad. I use to love this game. now they emphasize the matching game and it becomes near impossible to beat hard levels without spending a lot of money and joining active teams requires you to play the match for the tasks and you can complete the battle pass without playing the matching game. So pretty much any bonus rewards are behind a pay wall.

Playrix doesnt mind when players cheat. I am disgusted. A regatta competitor of ours is blatantly exploiting some vulnerability to destroy opponents. They have well over a MILLION points. Most of their players are level 50 or below, but their leader is a 388. The leader, tho, has nearly nothing in his town. The other players have 2000 helps. It simply isnt possible. Its been reported but they do nothing. SAVE YOUR MONEY, TRY A DIFFERENT GAME!!!!

This game was enjoyable but has gotten continually worse. The match three games are next to impossible, the bonuses keep getting fewer and far in between the building materials come at disproportionate amounts, buildings take forever and storage space is not enough for your goods. You can fix it but be ready to reach for your wallet and spend real money which is ultimately the developers goal.

Downgrade to 1 star because they got rid of the confirmation step before spending Tcash. Its too easy to accidentally and quickly lose your Tcash by inadvertently pressing the wrong button. They used to have the option in settings to require an extra step to confirm when spending Tcash to prevent accidents but now that option has disappeared. Bring that spending confirmation step option back and I will change the rating back to 5 stars.

Dont play this game unless you have a lot of real money to throw away. They have changed their mission  focus from the player to the bank. Otherwise, it would be fun to play.

I dont like the recent updates nor match 3 games. The option to confirm spending is gone  everytime I return to the main screen it now zooms in.

This game used to be great. The developers dont seem to care anymore. Theres no variation with the mini games, its the same one over and over. No effort put into decorating your town, this is the second year in a row theres been no Halloween or Christmas decorations in the shop. Nothing to get excited about anymore, and they dont listen to their users, because it never changes. Dont waste your time on this game.

It is a great game if you want to build a city on a tablet, phone, or computer! and the best part for me is that its free! So if youre interested in tycoon or simulation games, then try out township! But I have 2 small issues: first, everything costs way too much, and second, the cash that costs real life money feels greedy because i dont have money at this time. But other than those two issues its a great game

its a fun game. support is lacking. I did not receive a reward for an event I did. support is done through a bot and unclear if they even make a ticket to handle the issues

It used to be a really fun game but it seems like they try so hard to getaway you to spend money that its really hard to do anything its impossible to finish missions the match game is almost impossible it takes forever to build anything and the one thing I did pay for the monthly pass I cant even get halfway through NO FUN so I wont be doing that if I play at All

they just stole from me. They just changed a feature in the game and in doing so stole my tools for a game without compensation and added the option to purchase different, unhelpful tools. game is going downhill and probably not going to be playing much longer

Requires to much money to advance in game. Use to be reasonable and fun , but greed has ruined game, after years of playing and a lot of money to build my city, ready to look for new game. Why remove notice board and airplane button????? No land expansions !!! You ruined this game!!!! now game freezes up constantly, new buyers have ruined a perfect game!!!!!!!!

I am enjoy playing this game. Unfortunately, after I updated the game, why did all of my dollar money suddenly become 0 when before this I already have 56 dollars??!! Honestly, I would rate 5 stars, but after this accident, I couldnt give more.

its great no ads, you can play a candy crush like game while your waiting for things to process. and you can interact with other people helping them with items they need. I play sporadically its not the type of game you have to play all day to achieve gols.

please stop changing the game it was fine the way it was. Why change all the powerups? the new powerups are all wack. each update is just useless, focus your energy on the adventure,otherwise ,leave the game alone. those new powerups are soooooooooo useless

its the best game . my problem is , I dont know if the game is designed to find possible ways of consuming that coins at the puzzle game. seem to automatically switch to hard levels after purchase . makes the game too expensive

this is a scam. realised all the money i had was being saved to a piggy bank which i could access... if I paid 2.49. whether it even lowers in price or becomes free the more money is in it. eventually the game became unplayable because i had no money to buy building materials. the mini games became impossible unless you paid real money and so there was nothing to do... but wait. unfortunately for hours.

good addictive game But I just hate when the barn occupants drops down about 200 odd so your barn is always full. Legit cant play until it resets. Seems to be every month when the game updates. frustrating!!

I had activated confirmation for spending tcash and it asked me every time before i wanted to buy something but today i found out that without any notification the setting has been gone so I ended up spending 50 tcash accidentally. I opened the settings so I can turn it on again but this option wasnt there anymore! It is so unfair to change such thing without any announcement! I want my tcash back!

Well if I could I would give this app to zero stars because it refuses to open the app kept hounding me and hounding me to update so I finally did and now it refuses to even open so I guess I will no longer be using this app since I physically cannot

the minigame its to hard and impossible if i dont use my money for extra move, the extra move doesnt make sense, i know i got the hard level but just giving 16 move for 6 key and many grass, thats impossible unless i pay the extra move with money in the game btw, can you just give more move for a hard level.

Fun to play however it is way too expensive for me to buy cash as it cost 20xtimes more for me as I must take the exchange rate SA Rand to US into account, so for Sim cash of 4 I must pay R80. Not right.
